//! FCP Host - Node Gateway/Orchestrator for the Flywheel Connector Protocol
//!
//! This crate implements the host/orchestrator that:
//! - Supervises connector binaries in sandboxes
//! - Exposes an agent-facing API (local or mesh-facing)
//! - Delegates enforcement decisions to the `MeshNode` + policy engine
//! - Manages lifecycle (install/verify, configure, health, restart)
//!
//! Based on FCP Specification Section 10 (Gateway Architecture) and
//! bead `flywheel_connectors-oip0`.
