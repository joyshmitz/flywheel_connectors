{"id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78","title":"[FCP2] MVP: Mesh-Native Core Platform (Rust)","description":"# [FCP2] MVP: Mesh-Native Core Platform (Rust)\n\n## Why this exists\nWe are building the **FCP V2-only** reference implementation in Rust: a mesh-native, symbol-first, zone-isolated, capability-gated connector platform. The deliverable is the **system described by the FCP V2 specification + README + connector model guide**, implemented as a set of Rust crates and CLIs that can power a library of production connectors.\n\nThis epic is the parent for the concrete subsystem issues that implement the MVP conformance target.\n\n## Non-negotiable project constraints\n- **NO backwards compatibility:** We do **not** support FCP1/JSON-RPC compatibility modes, translators, or hybrid shims. If migrating from anything older, do a clean cutover.\n- **No unsafe Rust:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` everywhere.\n- **Ultra-optimized defaults:** low latency, low allocation churn, bounded memory spikes, predictable performance.\n- **Security is mechanical:** enforcement must not depend on agent prompts.\n\n## The three axioms (what everything must preserve)\n1. **Universal Fungibility:** Every durable thing is a content-addressed object that is symbol-addressable (RaptorQ). Even when transported via a control-plane stream, it must still have a canonical object form.\n2. **Authenticated Mesh:** Tailscale is transport and identity (node IDs, ACL tags). FCP must assume the tailnet is authenticated but still enforce crypto + policy.\n3. **Explicit Authority:** No ambient authority. All authority chains back to the owner root key via verifiable signatures.\n\n## MVP conformance target (ship this first)\nThis epic is complete when we have a V2-only platform that supports, at minimum:\n- **Canonical object format**: deterministic CBOR with schema-hash prefix; stable schema IDs/hashes.\n- **Security object addressing**: keyed ObjectId derivation bound to zone + schema for security-relevant objects.\n- **Zone crypto**: ZoneKeyManifest distribution (HPKE sealed boxes) and rotation.\n- **Capability system**: COSE_Sign1 (CWT) CapabilityTokens with grant_object_ids verification; aud_binary binding for risky ops.\n- **Revocation**: revocation objects + head/seq freshness semantics + policy (Strict/Warn/BestEffort).\n- **Receipts**: OperationIntent + OperationReceipt for exactly-once semantics where required.\n- **Audit**: AuditEvent chain + AuditHead + ZoneCheckpoint + DecisionReceipt for explainability.\n- **Wire protocols**:\n  - **FCPS** symbol-native data plane (frame format, per-symbol AEAD, per-session MACs).\n  - **FCPC** control plane (ordered, backpressured framing of canonical control-plane objects).\n- **RaptorQ + chunking**: symbol encoding/decoding for objects; ChunkedObjectManifest for large objects.\n- **Stores**: object store + symbol store + placement policy + background repair loop + retention/GC roots.\n- **MeshNode**: peer discovery via Tailscale, routing, admission control, and distributed coordination primitives (leases).\n- **Sandbox + egress proxy**: enforce NetworkConstraints and deny-by-default egress.\n- **Connector SDK + manifest**: connectors implement standard methods and embed a manifest; SDK makes this ergonomic.\n- **Conformance harness**: golden vectors, fuzz targets, and mechanical compliance checks.\n\n## Definition of Done (quality gates)\n- `cargo check --all-targets`\n- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`\n- `cargo fmt --check`\n- `cargo test` (including conformance tests)\n- Fuzz targets exist for the spec-required surfaces (frame parsing, handshake transcripts, token verification, key manifests).\n- Benchmarks exist for the hot paths (ObjectId, CBOR canonicalization, FCPS parse, RaptorQ decode).\n\n## Work breakdown (child issues)\nThis epic is intentionally decomposed into subsystem issues (types/crypto/protocol/store/mesh/sandbox/sdk/conformance). Each child issue must be self-contained with:\n- a crisp scope and non-goals\n- concrete deliverables\n- acceptance criteria and test strategy\n- performance and security considerations\n\n## Success Criteria\n- The MVP system can execute a V2 connector end-to-end under zone/capability enforcement, producing receipts and audit events.\n- Conformance suite is green (golden vectors + fuzz targets exist and run).\n- No unsafe code; performance budgets are tracked and not regressing.\n","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:17:46.576921276-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T01:22:24.675920704-05:00","labels":["core","fcp2","mvp"]}

Instead of building separate webhook handlers for each service, this meta-connector provides a unified HTTP endpoint infrastructure with per-service configuration.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. HTTP Endpoint Management\n- Dynamic endpoint creation/deletion\n- Unique URL per webhook source\n- Support for path-based routing (`/webhooks/{service}/{id}`)\n- Health check endpoints\n- CORS and preflight handling\n- Rate limiting per endpoint\n\n### 2. Signature Verification (Per-Service)\n- Pluggable verification strategies:\n  - HMAC-SHA256 (GitHub, Stripe)\n  - HMAC-SHA1 (legacy services)\n  - Ed25519 (Discord)\n  - API key header\n  - Basic auth\n  - Custom verification functions\n- Timing-safe comparison\n- Signature caching for replay prevention\n- Failed verification alerting\n\n### 3. Payload Transformation\n- JSON schema validation\n- Payload normalization to common event format\n- Field mapping/extraction\n- Nested payload unwrapping\n- Binary payload handling (multipart)\n- Compression support (gzip, deflate)\n\n### 4. Event Routing to Zones\n- Route events to appropriate FCP zones\n- Support multiple destinations per event type\n- Filter events based on payload content\n- Priority-based routing\n- Fan-out to multiple handlers\n\n### 5. Retry/Dead-Letter Handling\n- Configurable retry strategies:\n  - Exponential backoff\n  - Fixed interval\n  - Fibonacci backoff\n- Dead letter queue for failed events\n- Manual retry interface\n- Event replay capability\n- TTL-based expiration\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"github-repo-events\"\npath = \"/webhooks/github/main-repo\"\nsignature_type = \"hmac-sha256\"\nsignature_header = \"X-Hub-Signature-256\"\nsecret = \"${GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.github-automation\"\nevent_type_header = \"X-GitHub-Event\"\n\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"stripe-payments\"\npath = \"/webhooks/stripe/payments\"\nsignature_type = \"stripe\"\nsecret = \"${STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.billing\"\nretry_max = 5\nretry_backoff = \"exponential\"\n\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"discord-interactions\"\npath = \"/webhooks/discord/bot\"\nsignature_type = \"ed25519\"\npublic_key = \"${DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.discord-bot\"\n```\n\n## Event Format (Normalized)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"evt_abc123\",\n  \"source\": \"github\",\n  \"type\": \"push\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"webhook_id\": \"github-repo-events\",\n  \"payload\": { ... },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"delivery_id\": \"xyz789\",\n    \"signature_valid\": true,\n    \"received_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Support 10+ common webhook signature types\n- [ ] Sub-50ms processing latency\n- [ ] 99.9% uptime for webhook endpoints\n- [ ] Complete audit trail for all received webhooks\n- [ ] Zero data loss with dead-letter queue\n- [ ] Hot-reload of webhook configurations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- HTTP server framework (axum/actix-web)\n- Persistent queue for dead-letter handling\n- Zone routing system\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- All secrets stored encrypted\n- IP allowlisting per webhook (optional)\n- Request size limits\n- Timeout handling\n- DDoS protection integration","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:06.647234418-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:35.455928212-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:35.455928212-05:00","close_reason":"Duplicate of flywheel_connectors-3md (fcp.webhook-receiver: Inbound Event Gateway Connector)"}

Instead of building individual connectors for each service, we can leverage the growing MCP ecosystem by connecting to existing MCP servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. MCP Client in Rust\n- Implement full MCP client protocol in Rust\n- Support stdio, HTTP, and SSE transports\n- Handle MCP handshake and capability negotiation\n- Manage connection lifecycle (connect, reconnect, disconnect)\n- Support multiple concurrent MCP server connections\n\n### 2. Dynamic Tool Discovery\n- Query MCP server for available tools on connection\n- Subscribe to tool availability changes\n- Cache tool definitions with TTL\n- Handle tool versioning and deprecation\n- Support lazy loading of tool schemas\n\n### 3. Schema Translation (MCP → FCP)\n- Map MCP tool schemas to FCP action definitions\n- Convert MCP parameter types to FCP types\n- Handle required vs optional parameters\n- Translate MCP error codes to FCP error responses\n- Preserve metadata and documentation\n\n### 4. Capability Mapping\n- Map MCP capabilities to FCP permissions\n- Handle capability negotiation\n- Support capability-based access control\n- Document capability requirements per tool\n\n### 5. Zone Isolation\n- Each MCP server = separate FCP zone\n- Namespace tools by server (e.g., `mcp.github.create_issue`)\n- Isolate credentials per zone\n- Independent rate limiting per zone\n- Zone-level health monitoring\n\n### 6. Audit Trail\n- Log all MCP tool invocations\n- Capture request/response pairs\n- Track latency and error rates\n- Support structured logging (JSON)\n- Integrate with FCP audit system\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[mcp_servers]]\nname = \"github\"\ntransport = \"stdio\"\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"]\nenv = { GITHUB_TOKEN = \"${GITHUB_TOKEN}\" }\nzone = \"mcp.github\"\n\n[[mcp_servers]]\nname = \"filesystem\"\ntransport = \"stdio\"\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/allowed/path\"]\nzone = \"mcp.filesystem\"\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Connect to any compliant MCP server\n- [ ] Expose MCP tools as FCP actions\n- [ ] Zero manual configuration per MCP tool\n- [ ] Sub-100ms overhead for tool invocation\n- [ ] Graceful handling of MCP server failures\n- [ ] Complete audit trail for compliance\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- MCP specification documentation\n- FCP action definition format\n- Zone management system\n\n## References\n\n- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- [MCP Server Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:22:53.515206173-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:22:53.515206173-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","meta"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-7ju","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T12:38:16.710957765-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-7ju","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T12:38:16.775242441-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-7ju","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:31:28.786584393-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","title":"fcp.1password - 1Password Credential Management Connector","description":"# fcp.1password - 1Password Credential Management Connector\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `fcp.1password` connector provides secure, centralized credential management for the Flywheel Connector Platform. It enables agents to retrieve, generate, and manage secrets through 1Password's infrastructure, replacing scattered `.env` files with auditable, vault-scoped access.\n\n**Value Score**: 74/100 (Tier 3 - Specialized)\n**Archetype**: Request-Response\n**Priority**: P2\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### The Problem\n- Credentials scattered across `.env` files, config files, and hardcoded values\n- No audit trail for credential access\n- Manual credential rotation is error-prone and inconsistent\n- Agents need secrets to authenticate with other services\n- No centralized revocation capability\n\n### The Solution\n1Password connector provides:\n- **Centralized secret management** - Single source of truth for all credentials\n- **Audit trail** - Every credential access is logged and traceable\n- **Vault isolation** - Credentials scoped by environment, team, or purpose\n- **Credential rotation** - Programmatic rotation with CAAM integration\n- **Secure provisioning** - Agents receive credentials without human intervention\n\n---\n\n## Connector Architecture\n\n### Archetype: Request-Response\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     fcp.1password Connector                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                  │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐       │\n│  │  Item Lookup │    │   Password   │    │    Entry     │       │\n│  │  (Read-Only) │    │  Generation  │    │   Creation   │       │\n│  └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘       │\n│         │                   │                   │                │\n│         └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘                │\n│                             ▼                                    │\n│              ┌──────────────────────────────┐                    │\n│              │     Vault Zone Router        │                    │\n│              │  (per-vault isolation)       │                    │\n│              └──────────────┬───────────────┘                    │\n│                             │                                    │\n│         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐                │\n│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼                │\n│  ┌────────────┐      ┌────────────┐      ┌────────────┐         │\n│  │ Vault: Dev │      │ Vault: Prod│      │ Vault: Ops │         │\n│  │  (Zone A)  │      │  (Zone B)  │      │  (Zone C)  │         │\n│  └────────────┘      └────────────┘      └────────────┘         │\n│                                                                  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                             │\n                             ▼\n              ┌──────────────────────────────┐\n              │   1Password Connect API      │\n              │        or CLI                │\n              └──────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Operations\n\n### 1. Item Lookup (Default: Read-Only)\n\nRetrieve credentials from specified vaults.\n\n```rust\n/// Retrieve a secret item from a vault\npub async fn get_item(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    item: \u0026ItemRef,\n    fields: Option\u003c\u0026[FieldSelector]\u003e,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cSecretItem, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Retrieve specific field (e.g., password, username, TOTP)\npub async fn get_field(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    item: \u0026ItemRef,\n    field: \u0026str,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cSecretValue, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// List items in vault (metadata only, no secrets)\npub async fn list_items(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    filter: Option\u003cItemFilter\u003e,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cVec\u003cItemMetadata\u003e, OpError\u003e;\n```\n\n### 2. Password Generation\n\nGenerate cryptographically secure passwords.\n\n```rust\n/// Generate a password with specified policy\npub async fn generate_password(\n    \u0026self,\n    policy: \u0026PasswordPolicy,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cGeneratedPassword, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Password policy configuration\npub struct PasswordPolicy {\n    pub length: u8,           // 8-128 characters\n    pub uppercase: bool,\n    pub lowercase: bool,\n    pub digits: bool,\n    pub symbols: bool,\n    pub exclude_similar: bool, // Exclude 0/O, 1/l/I\n    pub exclude_ambiguous: bool,\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Entry Creation (Write Permission Required)\n\nCreate new credential entries.\n\n```rust\n/// Create a new login item\npub async fn create_login(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    item: LoginItem,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cItemId, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Create a secure note\npub async fn create_secure_note(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    note: SecureNote,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cItemId, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Create an API credential\npub async fn create_api_credential(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    credential: ApiCredential,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cItemId, OpError\u003e;\n```\n\n### 4. Vault Organization\n\nManage vault structure and item organization.\n\n```rust\n/// List accessible vaults\npub async fn list_vaults(\u0026self) -\u003e Result\u003cVec\u003cVaultMetadata\u003e, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Get vault details\npub async fn get_vault(\u0026self, vault: \u0026VaultId) -\u003e Result\u003cVaultInfo, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Move item between vaults (requires write on both)\npub async fn move_item(\n    \u0026self,\n    item: \u0026ItemId,\n    from_vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    to_vault: \u0026VaultId,\n) -\u003e Result\u003c(), OpError\u003e;\n```\n\n### 5. Secure Note Access\n\nAccess and manage secure notes for configuration data.\n\n```rust\n/// Retrieve secure note content\npub async fn get_secure_note(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    item: \u0026ItemRef,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cSecureNoteContent, OpError\u003e;\n\n/// Parse secure note as structured config\npub async fn get_note_as_config\u003cT: DeserializeOwned\u003e(\n

enum VaultPermission {\n    /// Can read items (default)\n    Read,\n    /// Can read and create items\n    ReadWrite,\n    /// Can read, create, and delete items\n    Full,\n}\n\nimpl Default for VaultPermission {\n    fn default() -\u003e Self {\n        VaultPermission::Read\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Principle 2: Never Expose in Logs\n\n```rust\n/// Secret value wrapper - prevents accidental logging\n#[derive(Clone, Zeroize, ZeroizeOnDrop)]\npub struct SecretValue(String);\n\nimpl std::fmt::Debug for SecretValue {\n    fn fmt(\u0026self, f: \u0026mut std::fmt::Formatter\u003c'_\u003e) -\u003e std::fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"SecretValue([REDACTED])\")\n    }\n}\n\nimpl std::fmt::Display for SecretValue {\n    fn fmt(\u0026self, f: \u0026mut std::fmt::Formatter\u003c'_\u003e)

\u0026[u8] {\n        self.0.as_bytes()\n    }\n    \n    /// Expose for actual use - call site is audited\n    pub fn expose_secret(\u0026self) -\u003e \u0026str {\n        \u0026self.0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Principle 3: Zone Isolation Per Vault\n\nEach vault operates in its own security zone:\n\n```rust\npub struct VaultZone {\n    pub vault_id: VaultId,\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,\n    pub permissions: VaultPermission,\n    pub allowed_items: Option\u003cVec\u003cItemPattern\u003e\u003e, // Optional allowlist\n    pub denied_items: Option\u003cVec\u003cItemPattern\u003e\u003e,  // Optional denylist\n}\n\nimpl OnePasswordConnector {\n    /// Access is scoped to zones configured for this connector instance\n    pub fn with_zones(zones: Vec\u003cVaultZone\u003e) -\u003e Self;\n    \n    /// Validate access before any operation\n    fn validate_zone_access(\n        \u0026self,\n        vault: \u0026VaultId,\n        item: Option\u003c\u0026ItemRef\u003e,\n        required_permission: VaultPermission,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003c(), ZoneViolation\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Principle 4: Time-Limited Credential Leases\n\n```rust\n/// Credential with automatic expiration\npub struct CredentialLease {\n    pub value: SecretValue,\n    pub expires_at: DateTime\u003cUtc\u003e,\n    pub lease_id: LeaseId,\n}\n\nimpl CredentialLease {\n    /// Check if lease is still valid\n    pub fn is_valid(\u0026self) -\u003e bool {\n        Utc::now() \u003c self.expires_at\n    }\n    \n    /// Get value only if lease is valid\n    pub fn get(\u0026self) -\u003e Option\u003c\u0026SecretValue\u003e {\n        if self.is_valid() {\n            Some(\u0026self.value)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n/// Request a time-limited credential\npub async fn get_leased_credential(\n    \u0026self,\n    vault: \u0026VaultId,\n    item: \u0026ItemRef,\n    ttl: Duration,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cCredentialLease, OpError\u003e;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Synergy\n\n### CAAM Integration (Credential Rotation)\n\n```rust\n/// CAAM uses 1Password as credential source for rotation\nimpl CredentialSource for OnePasswordConnector {\n    async fn get_current_credential(\n        \u0026self,\n        service: \u0026ServiceId,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003cCredential, CredentialError\u003e;\n    \n    async fn store_rotated_credential(\n        \u0026self,\n        service: \u0026ServiceId,\n        credential: \u0026Credential,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003c(), CredentialError\u003e;\n    \n    async fn get_rotation_history(\n        \u0026self,\n        service: \u0026ServiceId,\n        limit: usize,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003cVec\u003cRotationRecord\u003e, CredentialError\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Connector Provisioning\n\nAll connectors can use 1Password for secure credential provisioning:\n\n```rust\n/// Example: GitHub connector getting its token from 1Password\nimpl GitHubConnector {\n    pub async fn from_1password(\n        op: \u0026OnePasswordConnector,\n        vault: \u0026VaultId,\n        item: \u0026str,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003cSelf, ConnectorError\u003e {\n        let token = op.get_field(vault, \u0026item.into(), \"credential\").await?;\n        Ok(Self::new(token))\n    }\n}\n\n/// Generic provisioning for any connector\npub trait SecretProvisioned: Sized {\n    async fn provision_from_1password(\n        op: \u0026OnePasswordConnector,\n        vault: \u0026VaultId,\n        config_item: \u0026str,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003cSelf, ProvisionError\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Per-Vault Isolation\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Zone Configuration

(connector traits, error types)\n├── fcp-telemetry (audit logging, tracing)\n├── zeroize (secret memory cleanup)\n└── secrecy (secret value handling)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Integration Options\n\n#### Option A: 1Password Connect API (Recommended for Production)\n\n```rust\npub struct ConnectApiClient {\n    base_url: Url,\n    token: SecretValue,\n    client: reqwest::Client,\n}\n\nimpl ConnectApiClient {\n    /// Connect API is a self-hosted server\n    pub fn new(connect_url: \u0026str, token: SecretValue) -\u003e Self;\n    \n    /// All operations go through REST API\n    pub async fn request\u003cT: DeserializeOwned\u003e(\n        \u0026self,\n        method: Method,\n        path: \u0026str,\n        body: Option\u003c\u0026impl Serialize\u003e,\n    ) -\u003e Result\u003cT, ApiError\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Self-hosted, no CLI dependency, better for containers\n**Cons**: Requires Connect server deployment\n\n#### Option B: 1Password CLI Integration\n\n```rust\npub struct CliClient {\n    op_path: PathBuf,\n    service_account_token: SecretValue,\n}\n\nimpl CliClient {\n    /// Use service account for authentication\n    pub fn with_service_account(token: SecretValue) -\u003e Self;\n    \n    /// Execute op command\n    async fn exec(\u0026self, args: \u0026[\u0026str]) -\u003e Result\u003cString, CliError\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Simpler setup, no server needed\n**Cons**: CLI must be installed, process overhead\n\n### Service Account Configuration\n\n```rust\n/// Service account provides non-interactive authentication\npub struct ServiceAccountConfig {\n    /// Token from 1Password (OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN)\n    pub token: SecretValue,\n    \n    /// Vaults this service account can access\n    pub allowed_vaults: Vec\u003cVaultId\u003e,\n    \n    /// Permission level\n    pub permission: ServiceAccountPermission,\n}\n\npub enum ServiceAccountPermission {\n    /// Can only read items\n    Read,\n    /// Can read and create/update items\n    ReadWrite,\n}\n```\n\n### Vault Scoping\n\n```rust\n/// Scope connector to specific vaults\npub struct VaultScope {\n    /// Vault identifier (name or UUID)\n    pub vault: VaultId,\n    \n    /// Optional: restrict to specific categories\n    pub categories: Option\u003cVec\u003cItemCategory\u003e\u003e,\n    \n    /// Optional: restrict to items matching pattern\n    pub item_pattern: Option\u003cRegex\u003e,\n}\n\nimpl OnePasswordConnector {\n    /// Create connector with vault restrictions\n    pub fn scoped(scopes: Vec\u003cVaultScope\u003e) -\u003e Self;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n```bash\n# Required: Service account token\nOP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=ops_xxx...\n\n# For Connect API\nOP_CONNECT_HOST=https://connect.example.com:8443\nOP_CONNECT_TOKEN=eyJhbGc...\n\n# Optional: CLI path (if not in PATH)\nOP_CLI_PATH=/usr/local/bin/op\n```\n\n### Connector Configuration\n\n```toml\n[connector.1password]\n# Integration method\nmethod = \"connect_api\"  # or \"cli\"\n\n# Connect API settings\nconnect_host = \"https://connect.internal:8443\"\n\n# Vault

Handling\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]\npub enum OpError {\n    #[error(\"vault not found: {0}\")]\n    VaultNotFound(VaultId),\n    \n    #[error(\"item not found: {0} in vault

RateLimited { retry_after: Duration },\n    \n    #[error(\"1password api error: {0}\")]\n    ApiError(#[from] ApiError),\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Telemetry Integration\n\n```rust\n/// All operations emit structured telemetry\n#[instrument(\n    skip(self),\n    fields(\n        vault = %vault,\n        item = %item,\n        // Never log the actual secret value\n        otel.kind = \"client\"\n

Implement:\n- Token bucket with 3 tokens/sec refill\n- Exponential backoff on 429 responses\n- Request queue with priority (interactive \u003e batch)\n- Connection pooling to reduce overhead\n\n### PDF Extraction Pipeline\n```\nDownload PDF → Parse structure → Extract text → Segment sections → Clean/normalize\n      |              |               |                |                  |\n      +--cache------+--pdfium-------+--heuristics---+--headers---------+\n      +--streaming--+--fallback-----+--OCR(rare)----+--refs-extraction-+\n```\n\n### LaTeX Parsing\n```\nDownload .tar.gz → Extract .tex files → Parse structure → Extract content\n       |                 |                    |                 |\n       +--decompress----+--identify-main-----+--sections-------+\n       +--handle-multi--+--resolve-inputs----+--equations------+\n```\n\n### Citation Graph Challenges\n- arXiv API doesn't provide citation data directly\n- Options:\n  1. Parse references from PDF/LaTeX (unreliable)\n  2. Use Semantic Scholar API for citations (recommended)\n  3. Build internal citation index from parsed papers\n\n### Error Handling\n| Code | Meaning | Recovery |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| 400 | Bad Query | Validate query syntax |\n| 403 | Rate Limited | Back off significantly |\n| 404 | Paper Not Found | Paper withdrawn or ID invalid |\n| 500 | Server Error | Retry with backoff |\n| 503 | Overloaded | Wait and retry later |\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n### 1. Literature Search\n```\nAgent: \"Find papers on X published this year\"\n\n→ arxiv.search.advanced({\n    query: \"all:transformer attention mechanism\",\n    date_from: \"2024-01-01\",\n    categories: [\"cs.CL\", \"cs.AI\"],\n    max_results: 50,\n    sort_by: \"relevance\"\n  })\n```\n\n### 2. Paper Summarization\n```\nAgent: \"Summarize this paper\"\n\n→ arxiv.paper.get({ id: \"2301.12345\" })\n→ arxiv.paper.pdf.extract_sections({ id: \"2301.12345\" })\n→ [Pass sections to LLM for summarization]\n```\n\n### 3. Citation Analysis\n```\nAgent: \"What papers cite this one?\"\n\n→ arxiv.citations.get({ paper_id: \"1706.03762\" })  // Attention paper\n→ Returns: List of citing papers with metadata\n```\n\n### 4. Literature Review\n```\nAgent: \"Build literature review on topic X\"\n\n→ arxiv.search.semantic({ query: \"topic description\", limit: 100 })\n→ arxiv.paper.pdf.extract_sections({ ids: [paper_ids] })\n→ arxiv.citations.graph({ seed_papers: [key_papers] })\n→ [Synthesize into review document]\n```\n\n### 5. New Paper Monitoring\n```\nAgent: \"Monitor arXiv for relevant papers\"\n\n→ arxiv.monitor.create({\n    name: \"LLM Reasoning Papers\",\n    query: \"ti:reasoning AND (ti:LLM OR ti:language model)\",\n    categories: [\"cs.AI\", \"cs.CL\"],\n    frequency: \"daily\"\n  })\n\n[Daily polling checks for new matches]\n```\n\n## Integration Patterns\n\n### CASS Knowledge Indexing\n1. Search/monitor returns new papers\n2. Extract paper sections via `arxiv.paper.pdf.extract_sections`\n3. Generate embeddings for abstract + sections\n4. Store in CASS with paper metadata as provenance\n5. Enable semantic search across indexed research\n\n### Concept Mesh Extraction\n1. Extract key concepts from paper text\n2. Identify methodology, findings, limitations\n3. Map concepts to existing Concept Mesh\n4. Create new concept nodes for novel contributions\n5. Link papers to concepts bidirectionally\n\n### Research Agent Workflow\n```\nQuery → Search arXiv → Filter/rank results → Extract key papers\n                            ↓\n                  Build citation graph\n                            ↓\n           Extract and summarize each paper\n                            ↓\n              Synthesize literature review\n                            ↓\n            Identify gaps and future work\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Query parsing and validation\n- Atom XML response parsing\n- Rate limiter behavior\n- Date range handling\n- arXiv ID format validation\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock arXiv API with recorded responses\n- PDF download and extraction\n- Search result pagination\n- Monitor poll scheduling\n\n### E2E Tests (with real API, sandboxed)\n- Search returns valid papers\n- PDF extraction produces text\n- Rate limiting is respected\n- Error handling works correctly\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- **Caching**: Cache paper metadata aggressively (papers rarely change)\n- **PDF Caching**: Cache downloaded PDFs with TTL\n- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple paper lookups when possible\n- **Lazy Loading**: Don't download PDF until text extraction requested\n- **Streaming**: Stream large PDF downloads, don't buffer in memory","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:43:33.702665785-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T02:32:11.824180515-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8yxg","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:45:07.391173293-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8yxg","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:45:08.069346355-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8yxg","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:32:11.826603599-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

collection - user's curated content\n- **discovery**: Public catalog - no privacy concerns\n- **history**: Sensitive - reveals listening patterns and preferences\n- **profile**: Basic identity - minimal privacy impact\n\n---\n\n## Natural Language Use Cases\n\n### Playback Control\n```\nUser: \"Play some focus music\"\n→ get_recommendations(seed_genres=[\"focus\", \"study\", \"ambient\"])\n→ play(uris=[recommended_tracks])\n\nUser: \"Skip this song\"\n→ skip_next()\n\nUser: \"Play this on my speaker\"\n→ get_devices()\n→ transfer_playback(device_id=\"speaker_id\")\n```\n\n### Library Management\n```\nUser: \"Add to my liked songs\"\n→ get_playback_state() // get current track\n→ save_tracks(ids=[current_track_id])\n\nUser: \"Save this album\"\n→ get_playback_state()\n→ save_albums(ids=[current_album_id])\n```\n\n### Playlist Operations\n```\nUser: \"Create playlist for road trip\"\n→ create_playlist(name=\"Road Trip\", description=\"Created by Claude\")\n→ get_recommendations(seed_genres=[\"road-trip\", \"rock\", \"pop\"])\n→ add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist_id, uris=[recommended_tracks])\n\nUser: \"Add this to my workout playlist\"\n→ get_playlists()\n→ add_tracks_to_playlist(workout_playlist_id, uris=[current_track])\n```\n\n### Discovery \u0026 Search\n```\nUser: \"What was that song from earlier?\"\n→ get_recently_played(limit=20)\n→ Present tracks with timestamps\n\nUser: \"Find podcasts about machine learning\"\n→ search(q=\"machine learning\", type=\"show\", limit=10)\n\nUser: \"Show me songs similar to this\"\n→ get_recommendations(seed_tracks=[current_track_id])\n```\n\n### Analytics \u0026 Insights\n```\nUser: \"What are my top artists this month?\"\n→ get_top_artists(time_range=\"short_term\")\n\nUser: \"Analyze this song's vibe\"\n→ get_audio_features(id=track_id)\n→ Interpret: danceability, energy, valence, tempo, etc.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Extended Capabilities\n\n### Cross-Connector Integrations\n\n#### fcp.whisper Integration (Podcast Transcription)\n```\nUser: \"Transcribe this podcast episode\"\n→ fcp.spotify.get_episode(id) // Get episode metadata\n→ Extract audio URL (if available via API)\n→ fcp.whisper.transcribe(audio_url)\n→ Return searchable transcript\n```\n\n#### Audio Feature Analysis\n```rust\n// Spotify's audio features provide rich data:\nAudioFeatures {\n    danceability: f32,    // 0.0 - 1.0\n    energy: f32,          // 0.0 - 1.0\n    key: i32,             // Pitch class notation\n    loudness: f32,        // dB\n    mode: i32,            // Major/minor\n    speechiness: f32,     // Spoken word detection\n    acousticness: f32,    // Acoustic confidence\n    instrumentalness: f32,// Vocal presence\n    liveness: f32,        // Live performance\n    valence: f32,         // Musical positivity\n    tempo: f32,           // BPM\n    time_signature: i32,  // Beats per bar\n}\n```\n\n#### Mood-Based Recommendations\n```\n// Map user intent to audio features\n\"relaxing\" → { energy: \u003c0.4, valence: 0.3-0.7, tempo: \u003c100 }\n\"workout\"  → { energy: \u003e0.7, tempo: \u003e120 }\n\"focus\"    → { instrumentalness: \u003e0.5, speechiness: \u003c0.3 }\n\"party\"    → { danceability: \u003e0.7, energy: \u003e0.6 }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Authentication\n\n### OAuth 2.0 with PKCE\n```rust\n// Required scopes by zone\nconst PLAYBACK_SCOPES: \u0026[\u0026str] = \u0026[\n    \"user-modify-playback-state\",\n    \"user-read-playback-state\",\n    \"user-read-currently-playing\",\n];\n\nconst LIBRARY_SCOPES:

\u0026[\u0026str] = \u0026[\n    \"user-read-private\",\n    \"user-read-email\",\n];\n```\n\n### Token Management\n- Access tokens expire in 1 hour\n- Refresh tokens for long-lived sessions\n- Scope-based permission model\n- PKCE flow for enhanced security\n\n---\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n### Spotify API Limits\n```rust\n// Rate limit configuration\nRateLimitConfig {\n    // Spotify uses sliding window\n    requests_per_30_seconds: 100,  // Approximate\n    \n    // Endpoint-specific limits\n    search_rpm: 30,\n    playback_rpm: 60,\n    library_rpm: 100,\n    \n    // Retry behavior\n    retry_after_header: true,\n    exponential_backoff: true,\n    max_retries: 3,\n}\n```\n\n### Rate Limit Headers\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 100\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 95\nRetry-After: 30  // When rate limited\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Architecture\n\n### Dependencies\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nfcp-core = { path = \"../fcp-core\" }\nfcp-oauth = { path = \"../fcp-oauth\" }\nfcp-ratelimit = { path = \"../fcp-ratelimit\" }\nfcp-telemetry = { path = \"../fcp-telemetry\" }\n\n# HTTP client\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n\n# WebSocket for player state\ntokio-tungstenite = \"0.20\"\n\n# Serialization\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\n```\n\n### Core Structures\n```rust\npub struct SpotifyConnector

Option\u003cPlayableItem\u003e,\n}\n\npub enum PlayableItem {\n    Track(Track),\n    Episode(Episode),\n}\n```\n\n### WebSocket Player State\n```rust\n// Real-time player state updates\nimpl SpotifyConnector {\n    pub async fn subscribe_player_state(\u0026self) -\u003e PlayerStateStream {\n        // Note: Spotify doesn't have native WebSocket\n        // Implement polling-based stream or use Spotify Connect\n        PlayerStateStream::new(self.clone(), Duration::from_secs(5))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Spotify API Errors\n```rust\npub enum SpotifyError {\n    // Auth errors\n    InvalidToken,\n    ExpiredToken,\n    InsufficientScope(Vec\u003cString\u003e),\n    \n    // Rate limiting\n    RateLimited { retry_after: Duration },\n    \n    // Resource

BadRequest(String),\n    ServerError,\n}\n```\n\n### Premium vs Free Limitations\n```rust\n// Free tier limitations\n- No playback control via API (Premium only)\n- Limited skips\n- Shuffle-only on mobile\n- No explicit content control\n\n// Connector behavior\nif !user.is_premium \u0026\u0026 operation.requires_premium() {\n    return Err(SpotifyError::PremiumRequired);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Mock Server\n```rust\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use wiremock::{MockServer, Mock, ResponseTemplate};\n    \n    #[tokio::test]\n    async fn test_search_tracks() {\n

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-e3i9","title":"TEST: E2E Connector Verification Framework","description":"# TEST: E2E Connector Verification Framework (FCP2)\n\n## Overview\nEnd-to-end testing framework that verifies **connector implementations** against the **FCP V2-only** platform contract.\n\nThis framework is where we catch \"it compiles but violates the protocol/security model\" failures.\n\n## What this must validate (high-level)\n- Connectors implement the standard method surface (`--manifest`, handshake/describe/introspect/capabilities/configure/invoke/health/shutdown).\n- Connectors are **single-zone bound** for their lifetime.\n- Default deny is mechanical: no capability token → denial + DecisionReceipt.\n- Side effects are safe: OperationIntent/Receipt (and leases where required) prevent duplicate execution.\n- Secrets and PII do not leak to logs.\n\n## Test Scenarios\n\n### Protocol Compliance (FCP2)\n- [ ] Session handshake flow (`MeshSessionHello`/`MeshSessionAck`) success/failure cases\n- [ ] FCPC control-plane framing (ordered, backpressured, canonical object payloads)\n- [ ] FCPS data-plane frames (frame parsing, MAC verification, per-symbol AEAD)\n- [ ] Canonical encoding validation (schema-hash prefix + deterministic CBOR)\n\n### Capability \u0026 Authority\n- [ ] COSE_Sign1 CapabilityToken validation\n- [ ] Expired token rejection\n- [ ] Invalid signature rejection\n- [ ] `grant_object_ids` subset verification\n- [ ] Revocation freshness enforcement (Strict/Warn/BestEffort per policy)\n\n### Lifecycle Tests\n- [ ] Cold start performance (\u003c 50ms target)\n- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling\n- [ ] Crash recovery and restart policy behavior\n- [ ] Health check responses\n\n### Operations \u0026 Events\n- [ ] Introspection accuracy (schemas, risk tiers, hints)\n- [ ] Request/response matching\n- [ ] Streaming/event subscription lifecycle (if connector declares Streaming/Bidirectional)\n- [ ] Cursor-based replay semantics (if connector supports replay)\n\n### Security Boundary Tests\n- [ ] Cross-zone access blocked (must fail closed)\n- [ ] NetworkConstraints enforced (no raw sockets in strict/moderate)\n- [ ] Timeout enforcement\n- [ ] Rate limit compliance (connector and/or platform)\n\n## Test Harness\n\n### MockExternalService\n- Configurable response patterns\n- Latency injection\n- Error injection\n- Rate limit simulation\n- Authentication verification\n\n### ConnectorRunner\n- Spawn connector in subprocess (or run as WASI module)\n- FCPC/FCPS transport shim\n- Output capture (stdout/stderr/logs)\n- Resource monitoring (memory, CPU)\n- Timeout enforcement\n\n### Assertions\n- Protocol message validation via canonical CBOR + schema hash\n- Performance assertions\n- Security assertions\n- DecisionReceipt assertions (reason_code + evidence)\n\n## Logging \u0026 Reporting (REQUIRED)\n- Structured JSON logs for each test\n- Performance metrics collection\n- Test result summary\n- CI integration (JUnit XML or similar)\n\n### Required log fields\n- `timestamp`, `test_name`, `phase`, `correlation_id`, `duration_ms`\n- When applicable: `connector_id`, `operation_id`, `zone_id`, `session_id`\n- For denials: `decision=deny`, `reason_code`, `evidence` (object IDs)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Uses fcp-testkit (mock infrastructure)\n- Depends on core platform conformance artifacts

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-hc2","title":"fcp.cron: Scheduled Task Runner","description":"# Scheduled Task Runner Meta-Connector\n\n**Force Multiplier:** Time-based automation for FCP zones.\n\n## Overview\n\nMany automation workflows require scheduled execution: daily reports, periodic syncs, cleanup jobs, reminder systems. This meta-connector provides a robust scheduling infrastructure that triggers FCP actions on time-based schedules.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. Cron Expression Scheduling\n- Standard cron syntax (5-field and 6-field)\n- Extended syntax with seconds precision\n- Timezone-aware scheduling\n- Named schedules for common patterns\n- Cron expression validation and preview\n\n```\n# Standard patterns\n@hourly    = 0 * * * *\n@daily     = 0 0 * * *\n@weekly    = 0 0 * * 0\n@monthly   = 0 0 1 * *\n\n# Custom patterns\n*/15 * * * *     = Every 15 minutes\n0 9 * * 1-5      = 9 AM on weekdays\n0 0 1,15 * *     = 1st and 15th of month\n```\n\n### 2. One-Time Scheduled Tasks\n- Schedule task for specific datetime\n- Support for relative scheduling (\"in 30 minutes\")\n- Cancellation before execution\n- Rescheduling capability\n- Batch scheduling (multiple one-time tasks)\n\n### 3. Interval-Based Triggers\n- Fixed interval execution (every N minutes/hours/days)\n- Sliding window intervals\n- Jitter support for load distribution\n- Minimum interval enforcement\n- Pause/resume capability\n\n### 4. Task History and Logs\n- Complete execution history\n- Stdout/stderr capture\n- Execution duration tracking\n- Success/failure status\n- Searchable log storage\n- Log retention policies\n\n### 5. Failure Alerting\n- Configurable alert channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)\n- Alert on:\n  - Task failure\n  - Task timeout\n  - Consecutive failures\n  - Missed schedules\n- Alert suppression/snooze\n- Escalation policies\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[schedules]]\nname = \"daily-backup\"\ncron = \"0 2 * * *\"\ntimezone = \"America/New_York\"\naction = \"zone.backup.run_backup\"\nparams = { full = true }\ntimeout = \"1h\"\nalert_on_failure = true\n\n[[schedules]]\nname = \"hourly-sync\"\ninterval = \"1h\"\njitter = \"5m\"\naction = \"zone.sync.pull_updates\"\nretry_on_failure = 3\n\n[[one_time]]\nname = \"migration-task\"\nrun_at = \"2024-02-01T03:00:00Z\"\naction = \"zone.db.run_migration\"\nparams = { version = \"v2.0\" }\n```\n\n## Task State Machine\n\n```\nPENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED\n              ↓\n           FAILED → RETRYING → COMPLETED/FAILED\n              ↓\n         DEAD (max retries exceeded)\n```\n\n## Dashboard Features\n\n- Calendar view of scheduled tasks\n- Next N upcoming executions\n- Recent execution history\n- Live execution monitoring\n- Manual trigger capability\n- Bulk operations (pause all, resume all)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Sub-second scheduling precision\n- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent schedules\n- [ ] Missed task detection and alerting\n- [ ] Distributed execution (no single point of failure)\n- [ ] Complete audit trail\n- [ ] Hot-reload of schedule configurations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Persistent storage for schedules and history\n- Time synchronization (NTP)\n- Alert channel integrations\n- Zone action invocation system\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Handle daylight saving time transitions\n- Cluster-safe (only one instance executes)\n- Graceful shutdown (complete running tasks)\n- Clock skew tolerance\n- Long-running task support","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:20.104073834-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:35.225906099-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:35.225906099-05:00","close_reason":"Duplicate of flywheel_connectors-hiu (fcp.cron: Scheduled Task Runner Connector)"}

Without a secure injection mechanism, credentials will be handled unsafely.\n\n## Credential Model (NORMATIVE)\n\n### SecretHandle (what connectors see)\nConnectors NEVER receive raw credentials. They receive a SecretHandle:\n```\nSecretHandle {\n  secret_id: SecretId,\n  secret_type: SecretType,  // ApiKey, OAuthToken, Certificate, Custom\n  scope: SecretScope,       // which connector/operation can use\n  expires_at: Option\u003cu64\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### Injection Protocol\n1. **Connector declares** credential requirements in manifest:\n   ```toml\n   [[secrets]]\n   id = \"api_key\"\n   type = \"ApiKey\"\n   required = true\n   ```\n\n2. **Host verifies capability** token authorizes credential access:\n   - `secret:\u003csecret_id\u003e:read` capability required\n   - Capability MUST have matching connector_id as audience\n\n3. **Host injects credential** to connector via:\n   - Environment variable (for API keys): `FCP_SECRET_\u003cID\u003e=\u003cvalue\u003e`\n   - File descriptor (for certificates): passed as fd, connector reads and zeroizes\n   - Egress proxy injection (for OAuth): proxy adds Authorization header\n\n4. **Connector uses** credential, then:\n   - Memory containing credential MUST be zeroized after use\n   - SDK provides `SecureString` type with Drop zeroization\n\n### Egress Proxy Credential Injection (Preferred)\nFor HTTP-based APIs, credentials should flow through the egress proxy:\n```\nConnector → HTTP request without auth → MeshNode Egress Proxy\n                                              ↓\n                                        Proxy adds Authorization header\n                                              ↓\n                                        Request to external API\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Connector never sees raw credential\n- Credential injection is capability-gated at proxy level\n- Natural audit point for credential usage\n\n### Zeroize Discipline\nAll code handling credentials MUST:\n- Use `zeroize` crate for clearing\n- Never log credential values\n- Never include credentials in error messages\n- Never write credentials to disk (even temp files)\n- Use `secrecy::SecretString` wrapper type\n\n## MVP Scope vs Full Profile\n- **MVP**: environment variable injection + egress proxy injection\n- **Full Profile**: threshold secret reconstruction for high-value credentials\n\n## Tests\n- Unit tests: SecretHandle serialization (no credential leakage)\n- Integration tests: credential injection via env var\n- Integration tests: egress proxy adds auth header\n- Adversarial tests: connector cannot access undeclared secrets\n- Audit tests: credential usage is logged (but not credential value)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Connectors can use credentials without seeing raw values (via egress proxy)\n- Credential values never appear in logs or error messages\n- Capability verification gates all credential access\n\n","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:53:07.542098129-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T02:53:07.542098129-05:00","labels":["fcp2","mvp","secrets","security"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-kt9r","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:54:36.462831896-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-kt9r","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:54:36.560080415-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-kt9r","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:54:36.633658392-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

Architecture\n\n```\nZone 0 (Public):     Public SharePoint sites, shared documents\nZone 1 (Authorized): Personal OneDrive, owned documents\nZone 2 (Private):    Email content, calendar details, OneNote\nZone 3 (Sensitive):  OAuth tokens, app credentials, tenant secrets\n```\n\n### Capability Mapping\n| Capability | Zone | Risk Level | Description |\n|------------|------|------------|-------------|\n| `m365.mail.read` | 2 | Medium | Read email content |\n| `m365.mail.send` | 2 | High | Send email on behalf of user |\n| `m365.files.read` | 1 | Low | Read OneDrive files |\n| `m365.files.write` | 1 | Medium | Modify OneDrive files |\n| `m365.calendar.read` | 2 | Medium | Read calendar events |\n| `m365.calendar.write` | 2 | High | Create/modify events |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required FCP Crates\n- `fcp-core`: Base connector traits, zone management\n- `fcp-oauth`: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, token refresh\n- `fcp-webhook`: Webhook subscription management\n- `fcp-streaming`: Real-time event streaming\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: Service-specific rate limiting\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Metrics and tracing\n\n### External Dependencies\n- Microsoft Graph SDK for Rust (or custom client)\n- Azure Identity for auth\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Flywheel Beads Integration\n```\nMicrosoft Planner Task \u003c-----\u003e Flywheel Bead\n

Cross-Connector Workflows\n- **Gmail ↔ Outlook**: Email migration, unified inbox\n- **Google Drive ↔ OneDrive**: File sync workflows\n- **Linear ↔ Planner**: Task sync for hybrid teams\n- **CASS**: Index all Office documents for search\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Multi-Tenant Considerations\n- Support both single-tenant and multi-tenant apps\n- Tenant ID handling in token acquisition\n- Admin consent flow for organization-wide permissions\n\n### Large File Handling\n- OneDrive upload sessions for files \u003e 4MB\n- Chunked upload with resume support\n- Progress tracking for large transfers\n\n### Delta Sync\n- Use delta queries for efficient sync\n- Track delta tokens per resource type\n- Handle delta token expiration gracefully\n\n### Batching\n- Batch related requests to reduce API calls\n- Dependency handling in batch requests\n- Error handling for partial batch failures\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Common Error Codes\n| Code | Meaning | Recovery |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| 401 | Unauthorized | Refresh token or re-auth |\n| 403 | Forbidden | Check permissions |\n| 429 | Throttled | Respect Retry-After header |\n| 503 | Service Unavailable | Exponential backoff |\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- **Minimum permissions**: Request only needed scopes\n- **Token storage**: Use fcp-oauth secure token store\n- **Audit logging**: Log all operations for compliance\n- **Data residency**: Respect tenant data location settings\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Use Microsoft Graph Explorer for API testing\n- Mock Graph API responses with `fcp-testkit`\n- Test against developer tenant\n- Validate OAuth flows

Webhook: New ticket created\n2. Auto-categorize: Billing inquiry, priority normal\n3. KB search: Find 3 relevant articles (confidence \u003e 0.8)\n4. Macro suggest: \"Billing FAQ Response\" macro\n5. Draft response: Combine KB + macro with personalization\n6. Queue for agent: Present draft with one-click send\n7. Track: Resolution time, CSAT, suggestion acceptance\n```\n\n### Escalation Detection\n```\n1. Sentiment analysis: Negative (-0.7)\n2. Keyword detection: \"cancel\", \"frustrated\", \"manager\"\n3. Customer tier: VIP (top 10% spend)\n4. Repeat contact: 3rd ticket in 7 days\n5. Decision: Auto-escalate to senior agent queue\n6. Notify: Slack alert to support lead\n7.

`-input=false`\n3. **Credential Isolation**: Backend credentials via environment, not config files\n4. **Plan Verification**: SHA256 hash ensures plans are not tampered with\n5. **Audit Everything**: All state access logged for compliance\n6. **Protected Resources**: Critical infrastructure cannot be accidentally destroyed\n7. **Time-Limited Plans**: Stale plans must be regenerated\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] **v0.1**: Core operations (plan, apply, state inspection)\n- [ ] **v0.2**: Multi-workspace support, drift detection\n- [ ] **v0.3**: Resource import, module management\n- [ ] **v0.4**: Cost estimation integration (Infracost)\n- [ ] **v0.5**: Policy as Code (OPA/Sentinel integration)\n- [ ] **v1.0**: Production ready with full audit compliance\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n-

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-ro9b","title":"fcp.dropbox: Dropbox file storage connector","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement the Flywheel Connector Platform (FCP) connector for Dropbox, a leading file storage and collaboration platform. This connector enables file CRUD operations, folder management, sharing capabilities, search functionality, Paper document handling, and team administration through Dropbox API v2.\n\n## Value Assessment\n\n- **Value Score**: 70/100 (Tier 4)\n- **Priority**: P3\n- **Archetype**: Request-Response + Webhook\n\nDropbox serves as a critical file storage connector alongside fcp.s3 and fcp.onedrive, providing cloud file storage capabilities for the FCP ecosystem.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### API Integration\n- **API Version**: Dropbox API v2\n- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE\n- **Base URL**: https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/\n- **Content URL**: https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/\n\n### Zone Architecture\nThe connector operates across three distinct zones:\n\n1. **Personal Files Zone**\n   - User's personal file storage\n   - Individual file/folder operations\n   - Personal sharing settings\n\n2. **Shared Files Zone**\n   - Team shared folders\n   - Collaborative workspaces\n   - Shared links management\n\n3. **Team Admin Zone**\n   - Team member management\n   - Group administration\n   - Team-wide policies and settings\n   - Storage quota management\n\n### Dependencies\n- `fcp-core`: Core connector traits and types\n- `fcp-oauth`: OAuth 2.0 authentication flow\n- `fcp-webhook`: Webhook handling for file change notifications\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: Rate limiting (Dropbox uses sliding window limits)\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Observability and metrics\n\n## Operations\n\n### File Operations\n- `files.upload` - Upload files (chunked for large files)\n- `files.download` - Download file content\n- `files.get_metadata` - Get file/folder metadata\n- `files.delete` - Delete files/folders\n- `files.copy` - Copy files/folders\n- `files.move` -

|\n| Long text | ✓ | ✓ | Markdown support |\n| Attachment | ✓ | ✓ | Upload via URL |\n| Checkbox | ✓ | ✓ | Boolean |\n| Multiple select | ✓ | ✓ | Array of options |\n| Single select | ✓ | ✓ | Single option |\n| Date | ✓ | ✓ | ISO format |\n| Phone number | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| Email | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| URL | ✓ | ✓ | |\n| Number | ✓ | ✓ | Integer or decimal |\n| Currency | ✓ | ✓ | With currency symbol |\n| Percent | ✓ | ✓ | 0-100 or decimal |\n| Duration | ✓ | ✓ | In seconds |\n| Rating | ✓ | ✓ | 1-5 or 1-10 |\n| Barcode | ✓ | ✓ | Text with barcode display |\n\n### Linked Fields\n| Type | Read | Write | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Link to another record | ✓ | ✓ | Array of record IDs |\n| Lookup | ✓ | ✗ | Computed from linked |\n| Rollup | ✓ | ✗ | Aggregation of linked |\n| Count | ✓ | ✗ | Count of linked |\n\n### Computed Fields\n| Type | Read | Write | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Formula | ✓ | ✗ | Computed value |\n| Auto number | ✓ | ✗ | Sequential |\n| Created time | ✓ | ✗ | Automatic |\n| Last modified time | ✓ | ✗ | Automatic |\n| Created by | ✓ | ✗ | Automatic |\n| Last modified by | ✓ | ✗ | Automatic |\n\n## Query Language\n\n### Filter Formulas\n```\n// Find all records where Status is \"Active\"\n{Status} = \"Active\"\n\n// Find records with Due Date in next 7 days\nIS_BEFORE({Due Date}, DATEADD(TODAY(), 7, \"days\"))\n\n// Find records where Priority \u003e 3\n{Priority} \u003e 3\n\n// Complex filter\nAND({Status} = \"Open\", {Assignee} = BLANK())\n```\n\n### Sorting\n```rust\nAirtableQuery::new()\n    .filter(\"{Status} = Active\")\n    .sort(\"Priority\", Desc)\n    .sort(\"Created\", Asc)\n    .page_size(100)\n```\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n```\nZone 0 (Public):     Shared base read (if configured)\nZone 1 (Authorized): Full CRUD on accessible bases\nZone 2 (Private):    Attachment content, collaborator data\nZone 3 (Sensitive):  API key, OAuth tokens\n```\n\n### Capability Mapping\n| Capability | Zone | Risk Level | Description |\n|------------|------|------------|-------------|\n| `airtable.records.read` | 1 | Low | Read records |\n| `airtable.records.write` | 1 | Medium | Create/update records |\n| `airtable.records.delete` | 1 | High | Delete records |\n| `airtable.schema.read` | 1 | Low | Read base schema |\n| `airtable.schema.write` | 1 | High | Modify schema |\n| `airtable.webhooks` | 1 | Medium | Manage webhooks |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required FCP Crates\n- `fcp-core`: Base connector traits, zone management\n- `fcp-oauth`: OAuth 2.0 authentication\n- `fcp-webhook`: Webhook handling\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: Rate limit management (5 requests/sec)\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Metrics and tracing\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Authentication\n- **Personal Access Token**: Simple bearer token\n- **OAuth 2.0**: For multi-user apps\n- Scope-based permissions\n\n### Rate Limiting\n- **5 requests per second** per base\n- Use batch operations to maximize throughput\n- Implement request queuing with backpressure\n\n### Pagination\n- Default 100 records per page (max 100)\n- Use `offset` token for continuation\n- Automatic depagination for list operations\n\n### Batch Operations\n- Create/update/delete up to 10 records per request\n- Use batching for bulk operations\n- Handle partial failures in batches\n\n### Field ID vs Name\n- Fields can be referenced by ID or name\n- IDs are stable across renames\n- Names are human-readable\n- Support both in queries\n\n### Error Handling\n| Code | Meaning | Recovery |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| 401 | Unauthorized | Refresh token |\n| 403 | Forbidden | Check base permissions |\n| 404 | Not Found | Base/table/record deleted |\n| 422 | Invalid Request | Check field values |\n| 429 | Rate Limited | Backoff (use Retry-After) |\n\n## Integration Patterns\n\n### Beads ↔ Airtable Sync\n```\nAirtable Table \"Tasks\" \u003c-----\u003e Flywheel Beads\n    |                              |\n    +-- Name ---------------\u003e

+-- Due Date -----------\u003e due_date\n```\n\n### Common Use Cases\n- **Lead tracking**: Store leads from various sources\n- **Content calendar**: Manage content pipeline\n- **Inventory management**: Track products/stock\n- **Project tracking**: Task lists with custom fields\n- **CRM**: Simple customer relationship tracking\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Mock Airtable API with `fcp-testkit`\n- Test filter formula parsing\n- Test batch operation handling\n- Test pagination\n- Test all field types\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:40:08.386425235-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T02:29:38.646453676-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier2"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-soft","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lj2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:01.937211059-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-soft","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-vi7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:01.963620477-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-soft","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:01.98856127-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-soft","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:02.015881373-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-soft","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:29:38.648751945-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

\"standard\"  # or \"custom\"\nconflict_resolution = \"last_write_wins\"\nsync_direction = \"bidirectional\"  # or \"jira_to_beads\", \"beads_to_jira\"\nissue_types = [\"Task\", \"Bug\", \"Story\"]\nexcluded_statuses = [\"Done\", \"Won't Do\"]\n```\n\n### Sync Events\n- Issue created in Jira → Create bead\n- Issue updated in Jira → Update bead (if mapped)\n- Bead created → Create issue (if sync enabled)\n- Bead status change → Transition issue\n- Conflict detected → Log + optionally notify\n\n## Jira Cloud vs Server/DC\n\n### API Differences\n| Feature | Cloud | Server/DC |\n|---------|-------|-----------|\n| Auth | OAuth 2.0 / API Token | Basic Auth / PAT |\n| Base URL | `*.atlassian.net` | Self-hosted |\n| API Version | REST v3 | REST v2 |\n| Webhooks | Cloud webhooks | Server webhooks |\n| Rate Limits | Per-user limits | Server capacity |\n\n### Configuration\n```toml\n[jira]\ndeployment = \"cloud\"  # or \"server\"\nbase_url = \"https://company.atlassian.net\"  # or self-hosted URL\napi_version = \"3\"  # or \"2\" for server\n\n[jira.auth.cloud]\noauth_client_id = \"...\"\noauth_client_secret = \"...\"\n\n[jira.auth.server]\nusername = \"...\"\napi_token = \"...\"\n```\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n```\nZone 0 (Public):     Public projects (if any)\nZone 1 (Authorized): Project issues user has access to\nZone 2 (Private):    Issue comments marked internal, worklogs\nZone 3 (Sensitive):  OAuth tokens, API credentials\n```\n\n### Capability Mapping\n| Capability | Zone | Risk Level | Description |\n|------------|------|------------|-------------|\n| `jira.issue.read` | 1 | Low | Read issue data |\n| `jira.issue.write` | 1 | Medium | Create/update issues |\n| `jira.issue.delete` | 1 | High | Delete issues |\n| `jira.issue.transition` | 1 | Medium | Change issue status |\n| `jira.worklog.write` | 2 | Medium | Log time |\n| `jira.admin` | 3 | Critical | Admin operations |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required FCP Crates\n- `fcp-core`: Base connector traits, zone management\n- `fcp-oauth`: OAuth 2.0 for Cloud, Basic Auth for Server\n- `fcp-webhook`: Webhook registration and handling\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: Rate limit management\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Metrics and tracing\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Custom Field Handling\n- Discover custom field IDs at runtime\n- Map common fields (Story Points, Sprint, Epic Link)\n- Support custom field types (cascading select, multi-select)\n- Handle field contexts (different projects = different options)\n\n### Atlassian Document Format (ADF)\n- Jira Cloud uses ADF for rich text (description, comments)\n- Convert markdown ↔ ADF\n- Handle embedded images, mentions, links\n- Preserve formatting on round-trip\n\n### Pagination\n- Use `startAt` and `maxResults` for standard pagination\n- Handle `nextPage` links in v3 API\n- Implement automatic depagination for searches\n\n### Error Handling\n| Code | Meaning | Recovery |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| 400 | Bad Request | Check field values |\n| 401 | Unauthorized | Refresh token |\n| 403 | Forbidden | Check permissions |\n| 404 | Not Found | Issue/project deleted |\n| 429 | Rate Limited | Backoff and retry |\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Mock Jira API with `fcp-testkit`\n- Test both Cloud and Server API variants\n- Test JQL query building and parsing\n- Test ADF ↔ Markdown conversion\n- Validate bidirectional sync logic\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:38:50.694755557-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T02:28:14.104779327-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier2"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-x9af","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lj2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:07:52.758885628-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-x9af","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-vi7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:07:52.786207444-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-x9af","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:07:52.811491934-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-x9af","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:07:52.83817155-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-x9af","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:28:14.107676545-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

thoughts\n- **Niche Expertise**: Deep communities for every topic imaginable\n- **Historical Discussions**: Years of archived conversations\n- **Real-time Sentiment**: Immediate reactions to events/products\n- **Community Moderation**: Quality content surfaces through voting\n\n### AI Agent Use Cases\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis**: \"What are people saying about X on Reddit?\"\n2. **Trend Monitoring**: \"Monitor r/programming for emerging trends\"\n3. **Error Resolution**: \"Find discussions about this error message\"\n4. **Community Engagement**: \"Post to relevant subreddits about our launch\"\n5. **Market Research**: \"What do users think about competitor product Y?\"\n6. **Expert Discovery**: \"Find experts discussing topic Z\"\n\n## Dependencies\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nfcp-core = { path = \"../fcp-core\" }        # Core connector traits\nfcp-oauth = { path = \"../fcp-oauth\" }      # OAuth 2.0 flow management\nfcp-ratelimit = { path = \"../fcp-ratelimit\" }  # Rate limit handling\nfcp-telemetry = { path = \"../fcp-telemetry\" }  # Observability\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Reddit API Details\n- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 required for all operations\n- **Base URL**: https://oauth.reddit.com\n- **Rate Limits**: 60 requests per minute (OAuth), 10 req/min (anonymous)\n- **User-Agent**: Required custom user-agent string\n\n### Rate Limiting Strategy\n```rust\npub struct RedditRateLimiter {\n    requests_remaining: AtomicU32,\n    reset_time: AtomicI64,\n    // Reddit provides rate limit headers:\n    // X-Ratelimit-Remaining\n    // X-Ratelimit-Used\n    // X-Ratelimit-Reset\n}\n\nimpl RateLimiter for RedditRateLimiter {\n    fn check_limit(\u0026self) -\u003e RateLimitResult {\n        // Respect Reddit's headers\n        // Implement exponential backoff on 429\n        // Track per-endpoint limits\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### PRAW-like Patterns\nInspired by Python's PRAW library for familiar patterns:\n```rust\n// Lazy loading of content\nlet subreddit = reddit.subreddit(\"rust\");\nlet posts = subreddit.hot().limit(25);  // Not fetched yet\nfor post in posts {  // Fetched on iteration\n    println!(\"{}\", post.title);\n}\n\n// Comment forest traversal\nlet comments = post.comments();\ncomments.replace_more(limit: 32);  // Expand \"more comments\"\nfor comment in comments.list() {\n    // Flat list of all comments\n}\n```\n\n### Content Policies\n- Respect subreddit rules programmatically\n- Handle quarantined/NSFW content appropriately\n- Rate limit posting to avoid spam detection\n- Include proper attribution for cross-posts\n\n### Error Handling\n```rust\npub enum RedditError {\n    RateLimited { retry_after: Duration },\n    Forbidden { reason: String },\n    NotFound,\n    Banned { subreddit: String },\n    Quarantined { subreddit: String },\n    AuthExpired,\n    NetworkError(reqwest::Error),\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Mock Reddit API responses for unit tests\n- Integration tests against Reddit's test environment\n- Rate limit simulation tests\n- OAuth flow end-to-end tests\n\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Should we support Reddit's streaming API (if available)?\n- [ ] How to handle shadow-banned detection?\n- [ ] Cache strategy for frequently accessed subreddits?\n- [ ] Support for Reddit Premium features?\n\n##
