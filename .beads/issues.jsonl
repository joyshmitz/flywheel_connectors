OAuth flow with proper scope management\n2. Profile operations (me, basic get)\n3. Sharing/posting operations\n4. Company information retrieval\n5. Job search and listings\n6. Messaging (requires additional approval)\n7. Marketing APIs (partnership dependent)\n\n## Compliance Notes\n- GDPR data export support required\n- User consent for data access must be clear\n- Respect user privacy settings\n- LinkedIn Professional Community Guidelines apply\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- The functionality described in this bead is implemented with typed schemas + validation (no unstructured “stringly” interfaces).\n- Errors map to the FCP error taxonomy with correct retry semantics and no secret/PII leakage.\n- Mock-only unit/integration tests cover success paths and common failures and emit structured JSON logs per `flywheel_connectors-1n78.35`.\n","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:02:00.127224699-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:25:26.697070245-05:00","labels":["connector","professional","social","tier4"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lj2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:02:28.768855313-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:02:29.583917436-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:02:30.494740804-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-iv7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:02:31.33214164-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:37:14.689079133-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:07:29.153163175-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:31.268001302-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:31.679619957-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:32.092542651-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:32.522917394-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:32.938084268-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-14h8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.35","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:33.371224004-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78","title":"[FCP2] MVP: Mesh-Native Core Platform (Rust)","description":"# [FCP2] MVP: Mesh-Native Core Platform (Rust)\n\n\n## Goal\nBuild the FCP2 (V2-only) Rust reference implementation: mesh-native, symbol-first, zone-isolated, capability-gated core platform with conformance suite and performance budgets.\n\n## Why this exists\nWe are building the **FCP V2-only** reference implementation in Rust: a mesh-native, symbol-first, zone-isolated, capability-gated connector platform. The deliverable is the **system described by the FCP V2 specification + README + connector model guide**, implemented as a set of Rust crates and CLIs that can power a library of production connectors.\n\nThis epic is the parent for the concrete subsystem issues that implement the MVP conformance target.\n\n## Non-negotiable project constraints\n- **NO backwards compatibility:** We do **not** support FCP1/JSON-RPC compatibility modes, translators, or hybrid shims. If migrating from anything older, do a clean cutover.\n- **No unsafe Rust:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` everywhere.\n- **Ultra-optimized defaults:** low latency, low allocation churn, bounded memory spikes, predictable performance.\n- **Security is mechanical:** enforcement must not depend on agent prompts.\n\n## The three axioms (what everything must preserve)\n1. **Universal Fungibility:** Every durable thing is a content-addressed object that is symbol-addressable (RaptorQ). Even when transported via a control-plane stream, it must still have a canonical object form.\n2. **Authenticated Mesh:** Tailscale is transport and identity (node IDs, ACL tags). FCP must assume the tailnet is authenticated but still enforce crypto + policy.\n3. **Explicit Authority:** No ambient authority. All authority chains back to the owner root key via verifiable signatures.\n\n## MVP conformance target (ship this first)\nThis epic is complete when we have a V2-only platform that supports, at minimum:\n- **Canonical object format**: deterministic CBOR with schema-hash prefix; stable schema IDs/hashes.\n- **Security object addressing**: keyed ObjectId derivation bound to zone + schema for security-relevant objects.\n- **Zone crypto**: ZoneKeyManifest distribution (HPKE sealed boxes) and rotation.\n- **Capability system**: COSE_Sign1 (CWT) CapabilityTokens with grant_object_ids verification; aud_binary binding for risky ops.\n- **Revocation**: revocation objects + head/seq freshness semantics + policy (Strict/Warn/BestEffort).\n- **Receipts**: OperationIntent + OperationReceipt for exactly-once semantics where required.\n- **Audit**: AuditEvent chain + AuditHead + ZoneCheckpoint + DecisionReceipt for explainability.\n- **Wire protocols**:\n  - **FCPS** symbol-native data plane (frame format, per-symbol AEAD, per-session MACs).\n  - **FCPC** control plane (ordered, backpressured framing of canonical control-plane objects).\n- **RaptorQ + chunking**: symbol encoding/decoding for objects; ChunkedObjectManifest for large objects.\n- **Stores**: object store + symbol store + placement policy + background repair loop + retention/GC roots.\n- **MeshNode**: peer discovery via Tailscale, routing, admission control, and distributed coordination primitives (leases).\n- **Sandbox + egress proxy**: enforce NetworkConstraints and deny-by-default egress.\n- **Connector SDK + manifest**: connectors implement standard methods and embed a manifest; SDK makes this ergonomic.\n- **Conformance harness**: golden vectors, fuzz targets, and mechanical compliance checks.\n\n## Definition of Done (quality gates)\n- `cargo check --all-targets`\n- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`\n- `cargo fmt --check`\n- `cargo test` (including conformance tests)\n- Fuzz targets exist for the spec-required surfaces (frame parsing, handshake transcripts, token verification, key manifests).\n- Benchmarks exist for the hot paths (ObjectId, CBOR canonicalization, FCPS parse, RaptorQ decode).\n\n## Work breakdown (child issues)\nThis epic is intentionally decomposed into subsystem issues (types/crypto/protocol/store/mesh/sandbox/sdk/conformance). Each child issue must be self-contained with:\n- a crisp scope and non-goals\n- concrete deliverables\n- acceptance criteria and test strategy\n- performance and security considerations\n\n## Success Criteria\n- The MVP system can execute a V2 connector end-to-end under zone/capability enforcement, producing receipts and audit events.\n- Conformance suite is green (golden vectors + fuzz targets exist and run).\n- No unsafe code; performance budgets are tracked and not regressing.\n","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:17:46.576921276-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T08:55:10.1766885-05:00","labels":["core","fcp2","mvp"]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.1.1","title":"WORKFLOW: Specification Refinement with APR (V2 docs)","description":"# WORKFLOW: Specification Refinement with APR (V2 docs)\n\n## Goal\nCapture the APR-based iterative spec refinement workflow in a fully self-contained Bead so we do not need to reread README.md to run refinement rounds.\n\n## Context\nThe repo uses APR (Automated Plan Reviser Pro) + Oracle (browser automation) to run multi-round reviews of the FCP2 docs with GPT Pro.\n\nThis workflow is **for documents**, not for connector binaries or the runtime platform. It exists to continuously harden and clarify:\n- `FCP_Specification_V2.md` (authoritative)\n- `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md` (connector authoring + implementation guidance)\n- `README.md` (overview + ops/dev UX)\n\n## Scope\nIn scope:\n- How to install and run APR rounds.\n- How to include the implementation doc periodically.\n- How to run remotely (Oracle serve mode) when the dev box has no browser.\n- How to integrate APR feedback back into the docs in a disciplined way.\n\nOut of scope:\n- Any “backwards compatibility” plan with FCP1. FCP2 is a clean cutover.\n- Installing Node/npm tooling as a requirement for the shipped platform.\n\n## Why this matters\nThe spec is large and security-sensitive. Iterative AI review is a force multiplier, but only if:\n- we can repeat it reliably,\n- we can reproduce what changed and why,\n- and we integrate feedback in a way that preserves the spec’s internal consistency.\n\n## Baseline assumptions\n- You have a GPT Pro account available for Oracle/APR.\n- You can authenticate in a browser for the initial APR run.\n- You can run the workflow either locally or with Oracle serve mode over Tailscale.\n\n## Workflow configuration\nAPR workflow file: `.apr/workflows/fcp.yaml`\n\nExpected config (informational):\n- Documents:\n  - `readme`: `README.md`\n  - `spec`: `FCP_Specification_V2.md`\n  - `implementation`: `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md`\n\n## Setup (one-time)\nInstall APR:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/automated_plan_reviser_pro/main/install.sh\" | bash\n```\n\nInstall Oracle (browser automation):\n```bash\nnpm install -g @steipete/oracle\n```\n\nNote: Oracle is tooling only; it is not part of the FCP2 runtime distribution.\n\n## Running revision rounds\nFirst round (requires manual ChatGPT login):\n```bash\napr run 1 --login --wait\n```\n\nSubsequent rounds:\n```bash\napr run 2\napr run 3 --include-impl  # include implementation doc every 3–4 rounds\n```\n\nInspect status and output:\n```bash\napr status\napr show 5\n```\n\n## Remote/SSH setup (Oracle “serve mode”)\nUse this if your dev box is remote (SSH) and cannot open a local browser.\n\nOn your local machine (with browser):\n```bash\noracle serve --port 9333 --token \"your-secret-token\"\n```\n\nOn the remote server:\n```bash\nexport ORACLE_REMOTE_HOST=\"100.x.x.x:9333\"  # local machine’s Tailscale IP\nexport ORACLE_REMOTE_TOKEN=\"your-secret-token\"\n\n# test connection\noracle -p \"test\" -e browser -m \"5.2 Thinking\"\n\n# now APR works normally\napr run 1\n```\n\nImportant: use port `9333` (not `9222`) to avoid clashing with Chrome DevTools.\n\n## Integration discipline (how to apply feedback)\nWhen APR produces feedback for round N:\n\n1) Prime the coding agent with full context (don’t assume partial memory):\n- Read ALL of `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.\n- Read `FCP_Specification_V2.md` and `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md`.\n\n2) Integrate feedback carefully:\n- Treat GPT output as suggestions; validate each claim against the spec’s goals.\n- Prefer “mechanical enforcement” changes over editorial prose.\n- Ensure changes do not introduce FCP1 compatibility shims.\n\n3) Harmonize docs in this order:\n- Update `README.md` first for the human-facing story.\n- Update `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md` to keep connector authoring aligned.\n- Update `FCP_Specification_V2.md` last (authoritative) to ensure correctness.\n\n4) Commit in logical groupings with clear messages.\n\n## Useful APR commands\n```bash\napr status          # check Oracle sessions\napr list            # list workflows\napr history         # show revision history\napr diff 4 5        # compare rounds 4 and 5\napr stats           # convergence analytics\napr integrate 5 -c  # copy integration prompt to clipboard\n```\n\n## Key files\n- `FCP_Specification_V2.md` — main protocol specification\n- `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md` — Rust implementation guide\n- `.apr/workflows/fcp.yaml` — workflow configuration\n- `.apr/rounds/fcp/round_N.md` — GPT Pro output per round\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- A new contributor can run APR rounds without consulting README.md.\n- The workflow notes explicitly keep FCP2 V2-only (no FCP1 compatibility work).\n- The workflow documents remote mode and integration discipline.\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T10:19:27.462200646-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T10:48:55.19014682-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T10:48:55.19014682-05:00","close_reason":"Created docs/WORKFLOW_APR_Specification_Refinement.md - comprehensive APR workflow documentation covering setup (APR + Oracle), running rounds, remote/SSH mode with Oracle serve, integration discipline (document update order, feedback validation), useful commands reference, and V2-only reminders.

Without tamper-evident audit:\n- Incident response is guesswork\n- Compliance is unverifiable  \n- \"Why was this denied?\" has no answer\n- Compromised nodes can hide their actions\n\nFCP2 audit is **hash-linked and quorum-signed by construction**, making it:\n- Mechanically verifiable (any node can detect tampering)\n- Fork-detectable (multiple heads for same epoch trigger alerts)\n- Explainable (every denial includes evidence ObjectIds)\n\n### Design Principles\n1. **Tamper-evident by construction**: Hash-linked chains with monotonic seq\n2. **Explainable by default**: DecisionReceipt includes evidence ObjectIds\n3. **Efficient sync**: Monotonic seq enables O(1) freshness comparison\n4. **Byzantine-resilient**: Quorum-signed heads under n/f model\n\n## Normative Types (MUST implement per spec §23)\n\n### AuditEvent (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n/// Audit event (NORMATIVE)\n/// \n/// Append-only, hash-linked audit chain per zone.\n/// Each event links to its predecessor via `prev` and carries\n/// a monotonic `seq` for O(1) freshness comparison.\npub struct AuditEvent {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    /// Correlation ID for request tracing (16 bytes)\n    pub correlation_id: [u8; 16],\n    /// Optional full trace context (NORMATIVE when present in InvokeRequest)\n    /// Enables stitching mesh routing, connector execution, receipts, and audit together.\n    pub trace_context: Option\u003cTraceContext\u003e,\n    /// Event type (e.g., \"secret.access\", \"capability.invoke\", \"elevation.granted\")\n    pub event_type: String,\n    /// Actor who triggered the event\n    pub actor: PrincipalId,\n    /// Zone where event occurred\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,\n    /// Connector ID (if applicable)\n    pub connector_id: Option\u003cConnectorId\u003e,\n    /// Operation ID (if applicable)\n    pub operation: Option\u003cOperationId\u003e,\n    /// Capability token JTI (if applicable)\n    pub capability_token_jti: Option\u003cUuid\u003e,\n    /// Request object ID (if applicable)\n    pub request_object_id: Option\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n    /// Result object ID (if applicable)\n    pub result_object_id: Option\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n    /// Previous event in chain (hash link) - enables tamper detection\n    pub prev: Option\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n    /// Monotonic chain sequence number (NORMATIVE)\n    /// Enables O(1) freshness comparison: seq_a \u003e seq_b ⟹ a is fresher than b.\n    pub seq: u64,\n    /// When event occurred (Unix timestamp)\n    pub occurred_at: u64,\n    /// Signature by executing node\n    pub signature: Signature,\n}\n```\n\n### AuditHead (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n/// Audit head checkpoint (NORMATIVE)\n/// \n/// Quorum-signed checkpoint of the audit chain head.\n/// Enables fast sync without full chain traversal.\npub struct AuditHead {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    /// Zone this head covers\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,\n    /// Head event ObjectId (tip of the chain)\n    pub head_event: ObjectId,\n    /// Sequence number of head_event (NORMATIVE)\n    /// Enables O(1) freshness comparison without chain traversal.\n    pub head_seq: u64,\n    /// Fraction of expected nodes contributing (0.0-1.0)\n    pub coverage: f64,\n    /// Epoch this head was checkpointed\n    pub epoch_id: EpochId,\n    /// Quorum signatures from nodes (Byzantine-resilient)\n    pub quorum_signatures: Vec\u003c(TailscaleNodeId, Signature)\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### ZoneCheckpoint (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n/// Zone checkpoint for fast sync (NORMATIVE)\n///\n/// Quorum-signed checkpoint of zone state for efficient synchronization.\n/// Acts as the single GC root (so reachability GC is well-defined).\n/// Nodes can compare checkpoints to quickly determine staleness.\npub struct ZoneCheckpoint {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,\n    \n    // Enforceable heads (NORMATIVE):\n    pub rev_head: ObjectId,           // Revocation chain head\n    pub rev_seq: u64,                 // Revocation chain seq\n    pub audit_head: ObjectId,         // Audit chain head\n    pub audit_seq: u64,               // Audit chain seq\n    \n    // Policy/config heads (NORMATIVE):\n    pub zone_definition_head: ObjectId,\n    pub zone_policy_head: ObjectId,\n    pub active_zone_key_manifest: ObjectId,\n    \n    /// Monotonic checkpoint sequence (NORMATIVE; per-zone)\n    pub checkpoint_seq: u64,\n    pub as_of_epoch: EpochId,\n    /// Quorum-signed (Byzantine-resilient under n/f model)\n    pub quorum_signatures: Vec\u003cQuorumSignature\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### DecisionReceipt (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n/// Decision receipt for explainable allow/deny (NORMATIVE)\n///\n/// Content-addressed \"why allowed/denied\" record with stable reason_code\n/// and evidence ObjectIds.

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.14","title":"[FCP2] RaptorQ + Chunking: Symbol Encoding/Decoding, ChunkedObjectManifest, Decode DoS Mitigation","description":"# [FCP2] RaptorQ + Chunking: Symbol Encoding/Decoding, ChunkedObjectManifest, Decode DoS Mitigation\n\n## Goal\nImplement symbol encoding/decoding for mesh objects and large payload handling via RaptorQ fountain codes and chunked object manifests.\n\n## Background \u0026 Rationale\n\n### Why RaptorQ Fountain Codes\n\nFCP2 uses RaptorQ as the universal encoding scheme because:\n\n- **Any K' symbols reconstruct the original** (K' approximately K times 1.002)\n- **No symbol is special** - all are equally useful for reconstruction\n- **No coordination needed** - receivers don't need to coordinate which symbols they receive\n- **Lost symbols don't require retransmission** - any new symbol helps\n- **Multipath aggregation** - symbols from any source contribute equally\n- **DoS resistant** - no single symbol is critical\n- **Resumable without bookmarks** - just accumulate more symbols\n\n### Why Chunking for Large Objects\n\nRaptorQ is great for \"any K' symbols reconstruct the whole object\", but it forces all-or-nothing reconstruction and can cause memory spikes for large objects (binaries, attachments, big audit epochs).\n\nChunking enables:\n- **Partial retrieval** (first chunks first for streaming)\n- **Targeted repair** (repair the missing chunk, not the whole multi-MB object)\n- **Dedupe across versions** (chunk-level content addressing)\n- **Bounded memory** (reconstruct one chunk at a time)\n- **Smoother streaming** (progressive display)\n\n---\n\n## Normative Configuration\n\n```rust\n/// RaptorQ configuration (NORMATIVE)\n#[derive(Clone, Debug)]\npub struct RaptorQConfig {\n

FCP2 defines:\n\n### Unsigned View Construction\n\n1. Create an \"unsigned view\" of the object equal to the object with its `signature` field set to `None` (or removed)\n2. For multi-signature objects, also remove `quorum_signatures`\n3. Serialize the unsigned view using `CanonicalSerializer::serialize()` (schema-hash-prefixed deterministic CBOR)\n4. The signature MUST be Ed25519 over those bytes\n\n### Multi-Signature Ordering (NORMATIVE)\n\nWhen multiple parties sign the same object:\n\n```rust\n/// Sort quorum signatures for deterministic verification (NORMATIVE)\n///\n/// Before hashing/signing/verifying, sort signatures lexicographically by node_id.\n/// This ensures all parties derive identical bytes regardless of signature arrival order.\nfn sort_quorum_signatures(sigs: \u0026mut Vec\u003c(TailscaleNodeId, Signature)\u003e) {\n    sigs.sort_by(|a, b| a.0.as_bytes().cmp(b.0.as_bytes()));\n}\n```\n\n### Example: Signing a CapabilityToken\n\n```rust\nimpl CapabilityToken {\n    /// Create signable bytes (NORMATIVE)\n    pub fn signable_bytes(\u0026self, schema: \u0026SchemaId) -\u003e Vec\u003cu8\u003e {\n        // Create unsigned view\n        let unsigned = CapabilityToken {\n            signature: None,\n            ..self.clone()\n        };\n        CanonicalSerializer::serialize(\u0026unsigned, schema)\n    }\n\n    /// Sign the token\n    pub fn sign(\u0026mut self, key: \u0026SigningKey, schema: \u0026SchemaId) {\n        let bytes = self.signable_bytes(schema);\n        self.signature = Some(key.sign(\u0026bytes));\n    }\n\n    /// Verify signature\n    pub fn verify(\u0026self, pubkey: \u0026VerifyingKey, schema: \u0026SchemaId) -\u003e bool {\n        match \u0026self.signature {\n            Some(sig) =\u003e {\n                let bytes = self.signable_bytes(schema);\n                pubkey.verify(\u0026bytes, sig).is_ok()\n            }\n            None =\u003e false,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## ObjectId Derivation (Integration)\n\nObjectId derivation uses canonical serialization:\n\n```rust\nimpl ObjectId {\n    /// Create ObjectId from content, zone, and schema (NORMATIVE)\n    ///\n    /// Uses keyed BLAKE3 for:\n    /// - Performance (BLAKE3 is faster and parallel-friendly)\n    /// - Privacy (keyed hash prevents dictionary attacks on low-entropy objects)\n    pub fn new(content: \u0026[u8], zone: \u0026ZoneId, schema: \u0026SchemaId, key: \u0026ObjectIdKey) -\u003e Self {\n        let mut h = blake3::Hasher::new_keyed(\u0026key.0);\n        h.update(b\"FCP2-OBJECT-V2\");\n        h.update(zone.as_bytes());\n        h.update(schema.hash().as_bytes());  // ← Schema binding\n        h.update(content);  // ← Already canonical CBOR (schema-prefixed)\n        Self(*h.finalize().as_bytes())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CDDL Requirements (NORMATIVE)\n\nThe project MUST ship a CDDL description of all NORMATIVE CBOR objects:\n\n### File: `FCP_CDDL_V2.cddl`\n\n```cddl\n;

Setup handles already-configured state gracefully\n2. **Single Source of Truth** - A manifest defines everything. Setup scripts are generated from it\n3. **Security by Default** - HTTPS enforcement, checksum verification, no blind operations\n4. **Modern Defaults** - Latest versions, optimal configurations out of the box\n5. **Resumable** - If interrupted, re-running resumes from last completed phase\n\n**Implementation Pattern:**\n```rust\npub struct ProvisioningRecipe {\n    /// Unique recipe identifier\n    pub id: RecipeId,\n    /// Required steps (ordered, with dependencies)\n    pub steps: Vec\u003cProvisioningStep\u003e,\n    /// Idempotency tracking\n    pub completed_steps: HashSet\u003cStepId\u003e,\n    /// Audit trail\n    pub audit_events: Vec\u003cAuditEvent\u003e,\n}\n\npub struct ProvisioningStep {\n    pub id: StepId,\n    /// Human-readable description\n    pub description: String,\n    /// Step type (OAuth, Webhook, ConfigValue, etc.)\n    pub step_type: StepType,\n    /// Dependencies on other steps\n    pub depends_on: Vec\u003cStepId\u003e,\n    /// Idempotency check function\n    pub is_complete: Box\u003cdyn Fn(\u0026ProvisioningState) -\u003e bool\u003e,\n    /// Rollback function (if supported)\n    pub rollback: Option\u003cBox\u003cdyn Fn(\u0026mut ProvisioningState) -\u003e Result\u003c(), RecipeError\u003e\u003e\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### Zero-Touch OAuth Flows\n\n```rust\npub enum OAuthRecipe {\n    /// Standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE\n    AuthorizationCodePKCE {\n        authorization_url: String,\n        token_url: String,\n        scopes: Vec\u003cString\u003e,\n        /// Auto-open browser for user consent\n        auto_browser: bool,\n        /// Local callback server port\n        callback_port: u16,\n    },\n    /// Device Authorization Grant (for CLI/headless)\n    DeviceCode {\n        device_authorization_url: String,\n        token_url: String,\n        scopes: Vec\u003cString\u003e,\n        /// Polling interval (seconds)\n        poll_interval: u64,\n    },\n    /// Client Credentials (machine-to-machine)\n    ClientCredentials {\n        token_url: String,\n        scopes: Vec\u003cString\u003e,\n    },\n}\n```\n\n### Webhook Auto-Registration\n\n```rust\npub struct WebhookRecipe {\n    /// Target service's webhook registration endpoint\n    pub registration_url: String,\n    /// Events to subscribe to\n    pub events: Vec\u003cString\u003e,\n    /// Verification method\n    pub verification: WebhookVerification,\n    /// Auto-retry on failure\n    pub retry_policy: RetryPolicy,\n}\n\npub enum WebhookVerification {\n    /// HMAC signature verification (Discord, Slack)\n    HmacSignature { algorithm: String, header: String },\n    /// Challenge-response verification (Stripe)\n    ChallengeResponse { challenge_param: String },\n    /// Ed25519 signature (Twitter/X)\n    Ed25519Signature { public_key_header: String },\n}\n```\n\n### Agent-Friendly Provisioning Interface\n\nPer MCP best practices, provisioning MUST be agent-operable:\n\n```rust\npub trait ProvisioningInterface {\n    /// List required setup steps (MCP-compatible descriptor)\n    fn describe_setup(\u0026self) -\u003e SetupDescriptor;\n    \n    /// Get current provisioning state\n    fn get_state(\u0026self) -\u003e ProvisioningState;\n    \n    /// Execute a setup step (idempotent)\n    async fn execute_step(\u0026mut self, step_id: StepId) -\u003e Result\u003cStepResult, RecipeError\u003e;\n    \n    /// Validate complete setup\n    fn validate(\u0026self) -\u003e ValidationResult;\n}\n\npub struct SetupDescriptor {\n    /// MCP-compatible tool descriptor for setup\n    pub tool_descriptor: ToolDescriptor,\n    /// Required human interactions (minimize these)\n    pub human_prompts: Vec\u003cHumanPrompt\u003e,\n    /// Estimated time to complete\n    pub estimated_duration: Option\u003cDuration\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Provisioning Interface (SDK-facing)\n- Declare required external setup steps in manifest\n- Run setup flows via host (with explicit approvals)\n- Store resulting state as mesh objects (never secrets on disk)\n- Track completion status for idempotent re-runs\n\n### Recipe Objects\n- OAuth flows (redirect URLs, token exchange, PKCE)\n- Webhook endpoint verification and registration\n- Periodic polling schedules / cursors\n- API key validation and rotation\n\n### Progress Reporting\nUsing indicatif patterns:\n```rust\npub struct ProvisioningProgress {\n    /// Current step being executed\n    pub current_step: Option\u003cStepId\u003e,\n    /// Completed steps\n    pub completed: Vec\u003cStepId\u003e,\n    /// Remaining steps\n    pub remaining: Vec\u003cStepId\u003e,\n    /// Human actions pending\n    pub awaiting_human: Vec\u003cHumanPrompt\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n## Security Requirements\n- Any privileged setup produces audit events\n- Secrets handled in memory only;

For **Risky ops:** \n   - Pick the lease with higher `(exp, coordinator_id)` \n   - Log the fork\n   - Emit audit event\n\n## Fencing Token Semantics\n\nThe `lease_seq` is critical for safety:\n- Monotonically increases per (zone_id, subject_object_id)\n- Higher lease_seq wins deterministically, regardless of wall-clock expiry\n- Prevents \"zombie lease\" problems where an old lease holder believes it still owns\n\n## Lease Lifecycle\n\n1. **Request**: Node sends `LeaseRequest` to coordinator\n2. **Validation**: Coordinator checks quorum, existing leases\n3. **Grant**: Lease is issued with next `lease_seq`\n4. **Renewal**: Before expiry, holder requests renewal (increments lease_seq)\n5. **Expiry/Release**: Lease expires or holder explicitly releases\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **Exactly-Once (1n78.10)**: OperationExecution leases prevent duplicate side effects\n- **Connector State (1n78.33)**: ConnectorStateWrite leases implement singleton_writer\n- **Computation Migration (6o25.4)**: ComputationMigration leases coordinate handoffs\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- `Lease` and `LeaseRequest` schemas\n- Lease issuance and renewal flows\n- HRW coordinator selection\n- Conflict detection + tie-breaking rules\n- Fencing token enforcement\n\n## Tests\n\n- Unit tests: coordinator selection determinism\n- Unit tests: fencing token monotonicity\n- Integration tests: node failure leads to lease expiry and reassignment\n- Adversarial tests: overlapping leases are handled according to risk tier\n- Property tests: lease_seq always increases\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Exactly-once external side effects are enforceable via leases\n- Singleton-writer connector state is fenced correctly\n- Computation migration can hand off safely","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:49:54.96613894-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T18:42:29.576182822-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T18:42:29.576182822-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented Lease and LeasePurpose types with HRW coordinator selection and validation in fcp-core/src/lease.rs. 15 unit tests pass.","labels":["fcp2","leases","mesh","mvp","security"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:49:54.980911179-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:51:13.924129586-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:51:13.975805286-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.25","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:51:14.026045251-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.29","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:51:14.077848521-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.34","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.28","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T01:51:14.128057467-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

The goal is to make the symbol layer feel like a **mesh-native CDN + event log** with bounded overhead and strong DoS resistance.\n\n## Why This Matters\n- **Streaming needs replay**: if a node was offline, it must reconstruct the missing epoch(s) from symbols.\n- **Offline-first installs/updates**: connector binaries should be mirrorable and retrievable from peers, not only from a registry/CDN.\n- **Bandwidth is unreliable**: RaptorQ lets us retrieve *any* K symbols rather than “the exact missing pieces”, which plays well with P2P and partial availability.\n\n## Normative Alignment (Spec §20)\n### 20.1 Epoch-Based Event Buffer (NORMATIVE intent)\n- Events are finalized into epoch objects.\n- Epoch objects are content-addressed and symbol-distributed.\n- Epoch finalization emits enough symbols (incl. repair symbols) for reliable reconstruction under churn.\n\n### 20.2 Connector Binary Distribution\n- Binaries should be representable as symbol sets so they can be fetched from multiple sources (registry + peers) and resumed.\n\n## Scope / Deliverables\n### A) Epoch Event Buffer\n- Define an **epoch object model** suitable for deterministic reconstruction:\n  - `EpochId` / epoch sequence boundaries\n  - `EpochMetadata` (object id, size, symbol policy, producer node ids, coverage targets)\n  - `EpochEvents` payload object(s) (canonical CBOR), chunked if needed\n- Implement epoch lifecycle:\n  1. accumulate events in current epoch (bounded memory)\n  2. finalize epoch → produce canonical event bytes\n  3. encode to symbols using the canonical RaptorQ parameters\n  4. distribute symbols using existing SymbolRequest/repair plumbing\n  5. publish epoch metadata for discovery/replay\n- Replay API surface (host-side):\n  - `list_epochs(zone_id, since_epoch)`\n  - `fetch_epoch(epoch_id)` → reconstruct bytes via symbols → decode events\n  - “gap detection” and replay catch-up when node reconnects\n\n### B) Binary Distribution via Symbols\n- Treat connector binaries as **content-addressed objects** (already required by registry/supply chain).\n- Implement a distribution strategy that supports:\n  - parallel fetch (registry + peers)\n  - resumable partial progress\n  - bounded disk/memory impact\n- Explicitly integrate with supply chain verification:\n  - symbols/binary bytes are untrusted until verified against manifest checksum/signatures\n  - quarantine-by-default until verification completes\n\n## Mechanical Safety / DoS Considerations\n- Epoch and binary symbol reconstruction MUST be bounded:\n  - max concurrent decodes\n  - per-decode memory bounds (symbol buffer caps)\n  - per-decode wall-time budget and cancellation\n- Admission control MUST account for:\n  - symbol fetch amplification\n  - decode CPU budgets\n  - disk write amplification\n\n## Dependencies\n- RaptorQ + chunking primitives: `flywheel_connectors-1n78.14`\n- Store/placement/repair/quarantine: `flywheel_connectors-1n78.15`\n- Symbol routing + targeted repair plumbing: `flywheel_connectors-1n78.17` (esp.

Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Account Management\n- Link bank accounts via Plaid Link\n- List connected accounts\n- Get account balances\n- Manage Items (connections)\n\n### Transaction Access\n- Sync transactions (incremental)\n- Categorize transactions\n- Search transaction history\n- Detect recurring transactions\n\n### Financial Data\n- Account/routing numbers (ACH)\n- Identity verification\n- Investment holdings\n- Liability information\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Connect my bank account\"\n\"Get my current balances\"\n\"Show transactions from last month\"\n\"Categorize my spending\"\n\"Set up ACH transfer details\"\n\"Verify my identity for compliance\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Stripe Integration\n**Complete financial picture:**\n- Plaid for bank data\n- Stripe for payments\n- Unified revenue + expense view\n\n### HubSpot Integration\n- Financial data for customer profiles\n- Payment behavior analytics\n- Revenue forecasting\n\n### Airtable Integration\n- Transaction export to tables\n- Budget tracking dashboards\n- Financial reporting\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Balance alerts → agent threads\n- Transaction anomaly notifications\n- Financial status updates\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Link API**: Account connection flow\n- **Transactions API**: Transaction sync\n- **Auth API**: Account/routing numbers\n- **Identity API**: KYC verification\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `chrono` — Date handling for transactions\n- `secrecy` — Credential handling\n\n### Environment Selection\n| Environment | Use Case |\n|-------------|----------|\n| Sandbox | Testing with fake data |\n| Development | Testing with real banks |\n| Production | Live financial data |\n\n### Rate Limits\n```rust\nRateLimits {\n    requests_per_minute: 100,\n    concurrent_requests: 10,\n    // Per-endpoint limits

PII/NPI\n- Audit all data access\n- Never log account numbers\n- Environment isolation critical\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — API operations\n- `streaming` — Webhook event ingestion\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `{environment}.plaid.com:443`\n- Environment selected at deployment\n\n### Credential Injection\n- client_id + secret via egress proxy\n- access_token per Item via CredentialId\n- Never persist raw credentials\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `plaid.accounts.read` — List accounts\n- `plaid.balances.read` — Get balances\n- `plaid.transactions.read` — Sync transactions\n- `plaid.investments.read` — Holdings/securities\n\n### Sensitive Read Operations\n- `plaid.auth.read` — Account/routing numbers (Dangerous)\n- `plaid.identity.read` — PII verification (Dangerous)\n\n### Write Operations\n- `plaid.link.create` — Create link token\n- `plaid.link.exchange` — Exchange public token\n- `plaid.item.remove` — Disconnect Item (Dangerous)\n\n### Admin Operations\n- `plaid.webhooks.manage` — Configure webhooks (Dangerous)\n- `plaid.assets.manage` — Asset reports (Dangerous)\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Create Link Token\n```json\nPOST /link/token/create\n{\n  \"client_id\": \"{{injected}}\",\n

\"{{injected}}\",\n  \"cursor\": \"{{last_cursor}}\"\n}\n```\n\n### Get Auth (Dangerous)\n```json\nPOST /auth/get\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"{{injected}}\"\n}\n// Returns account + routing numbers\n```\n\n---\n\n## Threat Model\n\n### Hard Requirements\n- Never log account/routing numbers\n- Never log access tokens\n- Never log transaction descriptions in full\n- Secrets never touch disk\n- Default deny for all operations\n\n### Audit Requirements\n- All data access logged\n- All writes require AuditEvent\n- Correlation IDs for tracing\n- Retention policy compliance\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Request construction\n- Response parsing\n- Cursor handling for sync\n- Error responses\n- Webhook signature validation\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock Plaid API responses\n- Transaction sync simulation\n- Link flow simulation\n- Error handling\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints (environment-specific)\n- Dangerous operation approval flow\n- Audit logging verification\n- No credential leakage\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real Plaid API calls in unit tests\n- Link token creation works\n- Transaction sync functional\n- Balance queries work\n- Auth data requires approval\n- Credential injection via egress proxy\n- All V2 NORMATIVE requirements

RaptorQ symbols are NOT a secret sharing scheme—a single symbol can leak structure.\"\n\nKey differences from RaptorQ:\n- RaptorQ symbols can leak structure (not semantically secure)\n- Single RaptorQ symbol may reveal partial information\n- Shamir shares reveal NOTHING until k shares collected\n- Wrapped shares ensure a node cannot decrypt other nodes' shares\n\n**Design Philosophy:** \"Secrets are never complete anywhere\"\n\n## Normative Types (V2 Spec §17.3)\n\n### SecretObject\n```rust\npub struct SecretObject {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    pub secret_id: SecretId,        // Unique identifier\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,            // Zone binding\n    pub k: u8,                      // Threshold (need k shares)\n    pub n: u8,                      // Total shares distributed\n    pub scheme: SecretSharingScheme,\n    pub wrapped_shares: HashMap\u003cTailscaleNodeId, Vec\u003cu8\u003e\u003e,\n    pub rotation: SecretRotationPolicy,\n}\n```\n\n### SecretSharingScheme\n```rust\npub enum SecretSharingScheme {\n    ShamirGf256,  // Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(2^8)\n}\n```\n\n### SecretRotationPolicy\n```rust\npub struct SecretRotationPolicy {\n    pub rotate_after_secs: u64,    // Auto-rotate interval\n    pub overlap_secs: u64,         // Both old and new valid during rotation\n}\n```\n\n### SecretAccessToken\n```rust\npub struct SecretAccessToken {\n    pub jti: Uuid,                  // Unique token ID\n    pub secret_id: SecretId,        // Which secret\n    pub purpose: String,            // For audit trail\n    pub requested_by: PrincipalId,  // Requester identity\n    pub iat: u64,                   // Issued at\n    pub exp: u64,                   // Expires at (short-lived!)\n    pub signature: Signature,       // Approver signature\n}\n```\n\n### Ephemeral Reconstruction (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nimpl SecretObject {\n    pub async fn use_secret\u003cF, R\u003e(\u0026self, access_token: \u0026SecretAccessToken, f: F) -\u003e Result\u003cR\u003e\n    where F: FnOnce(\u0026[u8]) -\u003e R\n    {\n        // 1.

calling / tool use\n- Assistants API for stateful conversations\n- JSON mode for structured outputs\n\n### Embeddings\n- Text embeddings for semantic search\n- Document embedding for RAG pipelines\n- Code embeddings\n\n### Audio\n- Whisper for transcription\n- TTS for text-to-speech\n- Voice mode integration\n\n### Vision \u0026 Image\n- Vision (images in prompts)\n- DALL-E image generation\n- Image editing\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Transcribe this audio file\"\n\"Generate embeddings for these documents\"\n\"Create an image for this concept\"\n\"Analyze this image and extract data\"\n\"Convert this text to speech\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### LLM Router Integration\n- Part of the `fcp.llm-router` meta-connector strategy\n- Fallback when Anthropic unavailable\n- Different model strengths for different tasks\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- **Embeddings API is critical for CASS**\n- Generate embeddings for semantic indexing\n- Power vector search across Flywheel\n\n### Whisper Connector Synergy\n- Can use OpenAI Whisper API\n- Or local Whisper model via fcp.whisper\n- Consistent interface either way\n\n### Agent Mail\n- TTS for audio notifications\n- Transcribe voice messages\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Chat Completions** — Primary text generation\n- **Embeddings** — Vector generation\n- **Audio** — Whisper transcription, TTS\n- **Images** — DALL-E generation/editing\n- **Assistants** — Stateful conversation threads\n- **Fine-tuning** — Model customization management\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client with streaming\n- `async-sse` — SSE parsing for streaming\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `base64` — Audio/image encoding\n\n### Streaming Implementation\nSimilar to Anthropic, uses SSE:\n```rust\n// data: {\"choices\":[{\"delta\":{\"content\":\"token\"}}]}\n```\n\n### Assistants API\n- Threads maintain conversation state\n- Runs execute assistant on thread\n- File attachments for documents\n- Code interpreter tool\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:ai:openai:full` | Full access | All models, all capabilities |\n| `z:ai:openai:gpt4` | GPT-4 access | GPT-4 models only |\n| `z:ai:openai:gpt35` | GPT-3.5 access | Cost-effective option |\n| `z:ai:openai:embeddings` | Embeddings only | No generation |\n| `z:ai:openai:audio` | Audio only | Whisper + TTS |\n| `z:ai:openai:images` | Images only | DALL-E |\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — Standard request/response\n- `streaming` — SSE streaming for completions\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `api.openai.com:443`\n\n### Credential Injection\n- API key via `CredentialId`\n- Organization ID (optional) via config\n- Never write credentials to disk\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Text Generation\n- `openai.chat.completions` — Chat completions\n- `openai.chat.stream` — Streaming completions\n\n### Embeddings\n-

generation\n\n### Images (Dangerous - Cost)\n- `openai.images.generate` — DALL-E generation\n- `openai.images.edit` — Image editing\n- `openai.images.variations` — Image variations\n\n### Assistants\n- `openai.assistants.manage` — Create/update assistants\n- `openai.threads.manage` — Manage conversation threads\n- `openai.runs.execute` — Execute assistant runs\n\n### Fine-tuning (Dangerous)\n- `openai.finetune.manage` — Manage fine-tuning jobs\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Chat Completions\n```json\nPOST /chat/completions\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [...],\n  \"tools\": [...],\n  \"response_format\": {\"type\": \"json_object\"},\n  \"stream\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Embeddings\n```json\nPOST /embeddings\n{\n  \"model\":

\"1024x1024\",\n  \"quality\": \"hd\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Safety + Retries\n\n### Rate Limits\n- Different limits per model/capability\n- Respect `retry-after` headers\n- Implement token-bucket rate limiting\n\n### Cost Control\n- Track tokens per request\n- Image generation is expensive\n- Budget enforcement at zone level\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Request construction for all API endpoints\n- Response parsing (including streaming)\n- Token counting\n- Error handling\n\n### Integration Tests\n- wiremock-based API simulation\n- Multi-modal scenarios (text + image)\n- Embedding dimension verification\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates default deny + NetworkConstraints\n- Usage metrics accurate\n- Cost tracking functional\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes

Without clear advancement rules, checkpoints become inconsistent.\n\n## ZoneCheckpoint Structure (recap)\n```\nZoneCheckpoint {\n  zone_id: ZoneId,\n  checkpoint_id: ObjectId,\n  seq: u64,\n  \n  // Bound heads\n  audit_head_id: ObjectId,\n  audit_head_seq: u64,\n  revocation_head_id: ObjectId,\n  revocation_head_seq: u64,\n  policy_head_id: ObjectId,\n  config_head_id: ObjectId,\n  \n  // Quorum\n  signatures: Vec\u003c(NodeId, Ed25519Signature)\u003e,\n  timestamp: u64,\n}\n```\n\n## Advancement Protocol (NORMATIVE)\n\n### Trigger Conditions\nNew checkpoint SHOULD be issued when:\n- Time since last checkpoint \u003e checkpoint_interval (default: 60s)\n- Audit chain has \u003e N new events (default: 100)\n- Revocation chain has any new events\n- Policy or config changed\n\n### Advancement Steps\n1. **Coordinator Selection**: HRW hash over (zone_id, \"checkpoint\", epoch)\n2. **Proposal**: Coordinator broadcasts CheckpointProposal\n3. **Signature Collection**: Nodes sign if:\n   - All referenced heads are known and valid\n   - seq = prev_seq + 1\n   - timestamp is within skew tolerance\n4. **Finalization**: Once n-f signatures collected, checkpoint is published\n5. **Propagation**: All nodes update their frontier\n\n### Freshness Rules\n- Token verification: `token.chk_seq \u003c= local_checkpoint_seq` OR degraded mode\n- Revocation verification: `local_revocation_head_seq \u003e= policy_min_revocation_seq`\n\n## Fork Detection (CRITICAL)\n\n### Fork Condition\nA fork exists when two checkpoints have:\n- Same zone_id\n- Same seq\n- Different checkpoint_id\n\n### Fork Response\n1. **Immediate**: Halt checkpoint advancement\n2. **Audit**: Emit ForkDetected audit event with both checkpoint IDs\n3. **Alert**: Push alert to operator (cannot be auto-resolved)\n4. **Safe Mode**: Operations requiring fresh checkpoint MUST fail\n\n### Fork Prevention\n- Coordinator election is deterministic\n- Only coordinator can propose for given seq\n- Nodes reject proposals from non-coordinator\n\n## Convergence Protocol\nAfter partition heals, nodes must converge:\n1. Exchange frontier summaries\n2. Identify highest common checkpoint\n3. Replay missed checkpoints from peers\n4. Resume normal advancement\n\n## Tests\n- Unit tests: checkpoint advancement with quorum\n- Integration tests: partition → divergent checkpoints → heal → convergence\n- Adversarial tests: fork injection detected and halts advancement\n- Property tests: seq is always monotonic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Checkpoints advance reliably under normal conditions\n- Forks are detected and halt advancement\n- Convergence after partition works correctly\n\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:55:24.266866945-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T19:22:44.262539793-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T19:22:44.262539793-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented checkpoint.rs with core types: CheckpointTrigger, CheckpointProposal, ForkEvidence, ForkDetectionResult, CheckpointAdvanceState, CheckpointValidationError, FreshnessResult.

Enables agents to securely retrieve credentials for other connectors, manage secrets, and handle credential rotation. Essential infrastructure for secure autonomous operations.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Specialized Investment (Security + Foundation)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 2 Productivity (but with extreme caution)\n\n### Bitwarden Comparison\n- **1Password**: Enterprise focus, better UX, higher cost\n- **Bitwarden**: Open-source, self-hostable, lower cost\n- Both needed for market coverage in credential management\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Credential Retrieval\n- Read passwords/secrets\n- Access API keys\n- Get secure notes\n- Retrieve documents\n\n### Vault Management\n- List vaults\n- Search items\n- Read item metadata\n- Access shared credentials\n\n### Security Operations\n- Credential rotation support\n- Expiration tracking\n- Access audit\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Get the API key for Stripe\"\n\"What credentials do we have for AWS?\"\n\"Retrieve the database password\"\n\"List all items in the DevOps vault\"\n\"When does this credential expire?\"\n\"Get the SSH key for production server\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### ALL Other Connectors\n**Central credential store:**\n- 1Password is THE source for connector credentials\n- API keys stored in 1Password\n- OAuth tokens can be stored\n- Credential injection flows through here\n\n### Terraform/Kubernetes Integration\n- Infrastructure secrets\n- Service account keys\n- TLS certificates\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Credential sharing requests\n- Access approval workflows\n- Rotation notifications\n\n### Security Operations\n- Centralized secret management\n- Audit trail for access\n- Rotation automation\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n1Password offers multiple integration paths:\n\n- **Connect Server** — Self-hosted API gateway (recommended)\n- **CLI** — Command-line interface\n- **Service Accounts** — Direct API access\n\n### Connect Server Architecture\n```\nAgent → Connect Server → 1Password Cloud\n           (self-hosted)\n```\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n\n### Item Types\n| Type | Use Case |\n|------|----------|\n| Login | Username/password pairs |\n| Password | Standalone passwords |\n| API Credential | API keys/tokens |\n| Secure Note | Text secrets |\n| Document | File attachments |\n| SSH Key | SSH credentials |\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:secrets:1password:full` | Full access | All vaults |\n| `z:secrets:1password:vault:\u003cname\u003e` | Vault-scoped | Single vault |\n| `z:secrets:1password:readonly` | Read-only | No modifications |\n\n### Security Tiers\n- **EXTREME CAUTION** — This connector has access to all secrets\n- Audit every access\n- Minimal scope always\n- Never cache credentials in memory longer than needed\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — REST API operations\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\n- **Connect Server**: Self-hosted endpoint\n- **1Password.com**: Cloud endpoints (if direct)\n\n### Credential Injection\n- Connect Server token via environment or secure injection\n- Service account tokens via secure injection\n- NEVER write 1Password credentials to disk\n- Credentials retrieved here inject into other connectors\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `1password.vaults.list` — List accessible vaults\n- `1password.items.list` — List items in vault\n- `1password.items.read` — Get item details\n- `1password.items.fields` — Read specific fields\n\n### Write Operations (Very Dangerous)\n- `1password.items.create` — Create items\n- `1password.items.update` — Update items\n\n### Administrative (Extremely Dangerous)\n- `1password.items.delete` — Delete items\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### List Vaults\n```json\nGET /v1/vaults\n```\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"vaults\": [\n    {\"id\": \"abc123\", \"name\": \"DevOps\", \"type\": \"USER_CREATED\"},\n    {\"id\": \"def456\", \"name\": \"Shared\", \"type\":

/v1/vaults/{vault_id}/items?filter=title co \"stripe\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **Never Log Secrets**: Credential values must NEVER appear in logs\n2. **Minimal Hold Time**: Clear credential from memory immediately after use\n3. **Audit All Access**: Every credential read must be logged (without values)\n4. **Scope Minimization**: Only grant access to specific vaults needed\n5. **No Caching**: Never cache credentials beyond immediate use\n6. **Encrypted Transit**: All communication must be TLS\n\n### Access Pattern\n```rust\n// Correct pattern\nlet cred = get_credential(\"stripe-api-key\")?;\nlet client = StripeClient::new(\u0026cred);\ndrop(cred); // Clear immediately\n// Use client...\n\n// WRONG - holding credential\nlet cred = get_credential(\"stripe-api-key\")?;\n// ... lots of code ...\n// cred still in memory ❌\n```\n\n### Audit Requirements\nEvery access logged:\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"vault\": \"DevOps\",\n  \"item\": \"stripe-api-key\",\n  \"accessor\": \"agent-123\",\n  \"action\": \"read\",\n  \"fields_accessed\": [\"credential\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Credential Rotation Support\n\n### Rotation Workflow\n1. Agent detects credential near expiration\n2. Requests new credential generation\n3. Updates item in 1Password\n4. Updates consuming services\n5. Verifies new credential works\n6. Archives old credential\n\n### Expiration Tracking\n- Custom fields for expiration dates\n- Scheduled checks for approaching expiration\n- Alert workflows for rotation needs\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- API request construction\n- Response parsing\n- Field extraction\n- Vault enumeration\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock Connect Server\n- Multi-vault scenarios\n- Item type handling\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints\n- MANDATORY audit logging\n- No credential leakage in logs\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real 1Password calls in unit tests\n- Vault listing works\n- Item retrieval functional\n- NO credentials in ANY logs\n- Audit trail for all access\n- Immediate credential clearing\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:00:19.779265302-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:54:41.844763074-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:21.616862655-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:35:00.262651238-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:04.375039115-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:04.791899271-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:05.203992691-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:05.62286464-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:06.047486578-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:06.45431338-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-8egw","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.35","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:06.875044083-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

SecretAccessToken Tests\n- **Creation**: Valid signature from authorized approver\n- **Validation**: Verify signature, expiry, purpose\n- **Expiry**: Reject expired tokens\n- **Wrong secret**: Token for secret A cannot access secret B\n- **Replay prevention**: Token JTI tracking\n\n### 4. Ephemeral Reconstruction Tests\n- **use_secret() flow**: Token → audit → collect → reconstruct → closure → zeroize\n- **Zeroization verification**: Memory cleared after use\n- **Audit event creation**: Event logged before reconstruction\n- **Peer collection**: Collect k shares from mesh peers\n- **Partial failure**: Handle unavailable peers gracefully\n\n### 5. Secret Rotation Tests\n- **Auto-rotation**: Trigger rotation after rotate_after_secs\n- **Overlap period**: Both old and new valid during overlap\n- **Rotation coordination**: All peers receive new shares\n- **Rotation audit**: Audit event for rotation\n\n### 6. Integration with CredentialObject Tests\n- **Secret-backed credentials**: CredentialObject.secret_ref resolution\n- **Credential injection**: Secret used for auth without exposure\n- **Combined flow**: Credential → SecretAccessToken → reconstruction → injection\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nAll tests MUST emit structured JSON logs:\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"test_shamir_k_of_n_reconstruction\",\n  \"phase\": \"reconstruct\",\n  \"k\": 3,\n  \"n\": 5,\n  \"shares_used\": [1, 3, 4],\n  \"secret_len\": 32,\n  \"result\": \"success\",\n  \"timing_us\": 145\n}\n```\n\n## Property-Based Testing\n\nUse proptest for:\n- Any k shares from n can reconstruct (k \u003c= n)\n- k-1 shares reveal nothing (information-theoretic security)\n- Wrapped shares decrypt only with correct node key\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] 100% coverage of Shamir GF(2^8) math\n- [ ] All SecretObject lifecycle states tested\n- [ ] SecretAccessToken validation comprehensive\n- [ ] Ephemeral reconstruction verified with zeroization checks\n- [ ] Rotation with overlap tested\n- [ ] CredentialObject integration tested\n- [ ] Structured JSON logging in all tests\n- [ ] Property-based tests for cryptographic properties","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:42:38.50587702-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T08:56:40.999873001-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-9sg2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.35","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:42:45.644850381-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-9sg2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-6o25.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:47:29.80378836-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-a81","title":"fcp.stripe - Stripe Payment Platform Connector","description":"# fcp.stripe - Stripe Payment Platform Connector (FCP2)\n\n## Goal\nProvide an FCP2-compliant Stripe connector for payments/billing/webhooks with receipts+idempotency for all writes, strict auditability, and default-deny NetworkConstraints.\n\n## Strategic Context\n\n### Value Assessment\n**Strategic Value Score: 96/100** — Critical Tier 1 connector.\n\n**Why Critical**: Money is the lifeblood of business. Agents that can understand and act on financial data unlock autonomous business operations. Critical for any SaaS, freelancer, or business user. This is the financial operations backbone.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Quick Wins (High Value + Moderate Effort)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 2 Productivity (weeks 5-8)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec\\![ConnectorArchetype::Operational, ConnectorArchetype::Streaming]\n```\n- **Operational**: REST CRUD operations for payments, customers, subscriptions\n- **Streaming**: Webhook event ingestion\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::SingletonWriter\n```\n- **SingletonWriter**: Required for idempotency key management and webhook dedupe\n- State tracked: `{ idempotency_log: HashMap\u003cIdempotencyKey, ResponseId\u003e, webhook_event_ids: Vec\u003cEventId\u003e }`\n- Lease required for writer fencing\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Wasi\n```\n- **WASI recommended**: Financial connector with credential handling\n- Memory isolation prevents API key extraction\n- Critical for PCI compliance boundaries\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n    host_allow: vec\\![\n        \"api.stripe.com\".into(),\n        \"files.stripe.com\".into(),\n    ],\n    port_allow: vec\\![443],\n    deny_localhost: true,\n    deny_private_ranges: true,\n    deny_tailnet_ranges: true,\n    deny_ip_literals: true,\n    require_sni: true,\n    require_host_canonicalization: true,\n}\n```\n\n### TaintFlags (NORMATIVE)\nFinancial data handling:\n```rust\n// Webhook events are externally sourced\nwebhook_event.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::EXTERNAL_INPUT;\n\n// Customer-provided data (names, emails)\ncustomer_data.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::USER_SUPPLIED;\n\n// Internal financial records are trusted\npayment_record.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::NONE;\n```\n\n### SafetyTier per Operation\n| Operation | SafetyTier | Rationale |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| `stripe.payments.read` | Safe | Read-only listing |\n| `stripe.customers.read` | Safe | Read-only data |\n| `stripe.invoices.read` | Safe | Read-only history |\n| `stripe.payments.write` | Dangerous | Affects real money |\n| `stripe.customers.write` | Risky | PII management |\n| `stripe.subscriptions.write` | Dangerous | Recurring revenue impact |\n| `stripe.refunds.create` | Dangerous | Money out |\n| `stripe.webhooks.manage` | Dangerous | Inbound vector config |\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture (Critical for Financial Data)\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:financial:stripe:admin` | Full access | All operations |\n| `z:financial:stripe:billing` | Invoice/subscription | Create/manage invoices, subscriptions |\n| `z:financial:stripe:readonly` | Analytics only | Read-only access for reporting |\n| `z:financial:stripe:webhook` | Event processing | Receive and process webhooks only |\n\n### Security Boundaries\n- Financial zones should have **highest trust requirements**\n- No cross-zone data flow without explicit policy\n- Audit every access to payment data\n- Separate test/live mode instances\n\n### Single-Zone Binding\nA connector instance binds to exactly one `ZoneId` for its entire lifetime.\nThe connector MUST NOT multiplex multiple zones internally.\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Payment Operations\n- Payment and subscription management\n- Invoice generation and tracking\n- Refund processing\n- Dispute/chargeback handling\n\n### Customer Management\n- Customer data access and CRUD\n- Payment method management\n- Customer lifecycle tracking\n\n### Analytics \u0026 Reporting\n- Revenue analytics and reporting\n- MRR/ARR tracking\n- Churn analysis\n- Anomaly detection in payment patterns\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Check if customer X has paid\"\n\"Generate invoice for project completion\"\n\"Analyze MRR trends and report anomalies\"\n\"Handle subscription upgrade request\"\n\"Investigate failed payment and notify customer\"\n\"Create a refund for order #12345\"\n\"Whats our revenue this month vs last month?\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Route payment notifications to appropriate handlers\n- Escalate failed payments to human review\n- Thread customer billing conversations\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- Index customer payment history for pattern analysis\n- Semantic search across invoices and transactions\n- Learn from successful payment recovery patterns\n\n### BV (Beads Viewer)\n- Create beads for payment issues requiring attention\n- Track billing-related tasks (disputes, refunds)\n- Link financial milestones to project work\n\n### Gmail/Calendar Connectors\n- Auto-send invoice emails\n- Schedule payment reminders\n- Track customer communication history\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **REST API** with comprehensive coverage\n- **Webhook events** for real-time payment notifications\n- **Idempotency keys** for safe retries (MUST implement)\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client with connection pooling\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `hmac` + `sha2` — Webhook signature verification\n- `uuid` — Idempotency key generation\n\n### Critical: Idempotency Key Management\n**Hard requirement for all side-effecting operations:**\n```rust\n// Derive Idempotency-Key from OperationIntent\nlet idempotency_key = format\\!(\"{}:{}\", operation_intent.id, operation_intent.operation_id);\n```\n- Bind Stripe response IDs to OperationReceipts\n- Never retry without idempotency key\n- Log idempotency key usage for audit\n\n### PCI Compliance Considerations\n- Never store raw card numbers (use Stripe tokens)\n- Redact sensitive fields in logs\n- Use zone architecture to isolate financial data\n- Audit all access to customer payment data\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — REST CRUD operations\n- `streaming` — Webhook event ingestion\n\n---\n\n## Threat Model\n\n**Financial operations are high risk.**\n\n### Hard Requirements\n- Default deny for ALL operations\n- Strong audit + receipts for every side effect\n- Never log secrets, card numbers, or sensitive payment data\n- Idempotency keys for all mutations\n- Webhook signature verification required\n\n### Dangerous Operations\n- Any write operation can affect real money\n- Refunds can be abused\n- Subscription changes affect recurring revenue\n- Customer data is PII\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `api.stripe.com:443`\n- `files.stripe.com:443` (for file uploads)\n\n### Credential Injection\n- Stripe API key via `CredentialId`\n- Webhook signing secret via `CredentialId` (for event verification)\n- Use test keys (`sk_test_*`) for development\n- Never write credentials to disk\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `stripe.payments.read` — List/get payment intents\n- `stripe.customers.read` — Customer data access\n- `stripe.subscriptions.read` — Subscription details\n- `stripe.invoices.read` — Invoice history\n- `stripe.products.read` — Product catalog\n\n### Write Operations (All Dangerous)\n- `stripe.payments.write` — Create/confirm/capture/refund\n- `stripe.customers.write` — Create/update customers\n- `stripe.subscriptions.write` — Create/update/cancel\n- `stripe.invoices.write` — Create/finalize/pay/void\n\n### Administrative (Dangerous)\n- `stripe.webhooks.manage` — Webhook endpoint configuration\n- `stripe.products.write` — Product catalog management\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Payment Intent Operations\n- `payment_intent.create` — Create payment\n- `payment_intent.confirm` — Confirm payment\n- `payment_intent.capture` — Capture authorized payment\n- `payment_intent.cancel` — Cancel payment\n- `refund.create` — Process refund\n\n### Subscription Operations\n- `subscription.create` — New subscription\n- `subscription.update` — Modify subscription\n- `subscription.cancel` — Cancel subscription\n- `subscription.pause` — Pause billing\n\n### Customer Operations\n- `customer.create` — New customer\n- `customer.update` — Update customer data\n- `customer.get` — Get customer details\n- `customer.list` — List customers\n\n### Invoice Operations\n- `invoice.list` — List invoices\n- `invoice.get` — Get invoice details\n- `invoice.create` — Create draft invoice\n- `invoice.finalize` — Finalize for payment\n- `invoice.pay` — Charge invoice\n- `invoice.void` — Void invoice\n\n### Product Operations\n- `product.list` — List products\n- `product.create` — Create product\n- `price.list` — List prices\n- `price.create` — Create price\n\n---\n\n## Events (Streaming)\n\n### Webhook Event Handling\nIf webhook ingestion is supported:\n- Connector must NOT expose inbound ports\n- `fcp-host` receives webhooks and forwards verified payloads\n- Signature verification required before processing\n\n### Key Events to Handle\n- `payment_intent.succeeded` / `payment_intent.failed`\n- `invoice.paid` / `invoice.payment_failed`\n- `customer.subscription.created` / `deleted` / `updated`\n- `charge.dispute.created`\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Idempotency key generation and tracking\n- Webhook signature verification\n- API response parsing\n- Error handling for various failure modes\n\n### Integration Tests\n- wiremock-based API simulation\n- Webhook event simulation with valid signatures\n- Idempotency behavior verification\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates default deny + NetworkConstraints\n- Verifies idempotency behavior under retry\n- Confirms audit trail for financial operations\n- Tests credential redaction in logs\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- Deterministic tests; no live Stripe calls in unit tests\n- Idempotency keys work correctly for all mutations\n- Webhook signature verification functioning\n- No sensitive data in logs\n- Audit events emitted for all financial operations\n- All V2 NORMATIVE requirements

DigitalOcean Spaces | {region}.digitaloceanspaces.com |\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `aws-sdk-s3` — Official AWS SDK\n- `rusoto_s3` — Alternative SDK\n- `reqwest` — For custom implementations\n\n### Authentication\n- AWS Signature V4\n- IAM credentials\n- STS temporary credentials\n- Service account keys\n\n### Storage Classes\n| Class | Use Case |\n|-------|----------|\n| STANDARD | Frequently accessed |\n| INTELLIGENT_TIERING | Variable access |\n| GLACIER | Archive |\n| DEEP_ARCHIVE | Long-term archive |\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:storage:s3:full` | Full access | All operations |\n| `z:storage:s3:readonly` | Read-only | Download and list |\n| `z:storage:s3:bucket:\u003cname\u003e` | Bucket-scoped | Single bucket |\n| `z:storage:s3:write` | Write-only | Upload only |\n\n### Data Sensitivity\n- S3 often contains sensitive data\n- Bucket policies critical\n- Encryption requirements vary\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — REST API operations\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nVaries by provider:\n- AWS: `s3.*.amazonaws.com:443`\n- Custom: Configured endpoint\n\n### Credential Injection\n- AWS credentials via `CredentialId`\n- Access key ID + Secret\n- STS tokens for temporary access\n- Never write credentials to disk\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `s3.objects.read` — Download objects\n- `s3.objects.list` — List objects\n- `s3.objects.metadata` — Get metadata\n- `s3.buckets.list` — List buckets\n\n### Write Operations\n- `s3.objects.write` — Upload objects\n- `s3.objects.copy` — Copy objects\n\n### Administrative (Dangerous)\n- `s3.objects.delete` — Delete objects\n- `s3.buckets.manage` — Bucket operations\n\n### Presigned URLs\n- `s3.presigned.get` — Generate download URLs\n- `s3.presigned.put` — Generate upload URLs\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### List Objects\n```rust\nlet resp = client.list_objects_v2()\n    .bucket(\"my-bucket\")\n    .prefix(\"exports/\")\n    .max_keys(100)\n    .send()\n    .await?;\n```\n\n### Upload Object\n```rust\nclient.put_object()\n    .bucket(\"my-bucket\")\n    .key(\"path/to/file.txt\")\n    .body(ByteStream::from_path(\"local/file.txt\").await?)\n    .content_type(\"text/plain\")\n    .send()\n    .await?;\n```\n\n### Download Object\n```rust\nlet resp = client.get_object()\n    .bucket(\"my-bucket\")\n    .key(\"path/to/file.txt\")\n    .send()\n    .await?;\nlet body = resp.body.collect().await?;\n```\n\n### Generate Presigned URL\n```rust\nlet presigned = client.get_object()\n    .bucket(\"my-bucket\")\n    .key(\"path/to/file.txt\")\n    .presigned(PresigningConfig::expires_in(Duration::from_secs(3600))?)\n    .await?;\n```\n\n### Delete Object\n```rust\nclient.delete_object()\n    .bucket(\"my-bucket\")\n    .key(\"path/to/file.txt\")\n    .send()\n    .await?;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Provider Support\n\n### Configuration Pattern\n```rust\nstruct S3Config {\n    provider: S3Provider,  // AWS, MinIO, R2, etc.\n    endpoint: Option\u003cString\u003e,\n    region: String,\n    bucket: String,\n    path_style: bool,  // true for MinIO\n}\n```\n\n### Provider-Specific Notes\n- **MinIO**: Requires path-style URLs\n- **R2**: No bucket creation API\n- **GCS**: Limited S3 compatibility\n- **Spaces**: Full S3 compatibility\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Request signing\n- Response parsing\n- URL generation\n- Provider configuration\n\n### Integration Tests\n- LocalStack or MinIO for simulation\n- Multi-part upload testing\n- Large file handling\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints\n- Bucket-level access control\n- Audit logging for all operations\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real S3 calls in unit tests\n- Upload/download works\n- List operations functional\n- Presigned URLs work\n- Multi-provider support\n- Large file handling (multipart)\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:48:10.705196543-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:54:43.177643438-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:16.000657925-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-iv7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:16.029665486-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:53:16.058032141-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:31:34.626361009-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:16.672282635-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:16.831476426-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:16.983579909-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:17.138139771-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:17.298864786-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-aho","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:43:17.445753115-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

types\n- `fcp-webhook`: Inbound parse webhook handling\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: SendGrid rate limit management\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Email delivery metrics\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### SendGrid v3 API\n```rust\npub struct SendGridConnector {\n    client: HttpClient,\n    api_key: SecretString,\n    rate_limiter: RateLimiter,\n    webhook_handler: WebhookHandler,\n}\n\nimpl SendGridConnector {\n    pub async fn send_email(\u0026self, email: Email) -\u003e Result\u003cSendResponse\u003e;\n    pub async fn send_batch(\u0026self, batch: BatchEmail) -\u003e Result\u003cBatchResponse\u003e;\n    pub async fn get_stats(\u0026self, query: StatsQuery) -\u003e Result\u003cStats\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting\n- Global: 100 requests/second (starter), 600/sec (pro)\n- Email send: 600/minute (free), 10000/minute (paid)\n- Contact uploads: 3 concurrent jobs\n- Implement exponential backoff on 429\n\n### Webhook Signature Verification\n```rust\nimpl WebhookVerifier for SendGridWebhook {\n    fn verify(\u0026self, payload: \u0026[u8], signature: \u0026str) -\u003e Result\u003cbool\u003e {\n        // ECDSA signature verification\n        // Public key from SendGrid settings\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Email Types\n```rust\npub struct Email {\n    pub personalizations: Vec\u003cPersonalization\u003e,\n    pub from: EmailAddress,\n    pub subject: String,\n    pub content: Vec\u003cContent\u003e,\n    pub attachments: Option\u003cVec\u003cAttachment\u003e\u003e,\n    pub template_id: Option\u003cString\u003e,\n    pub dynamic_template_data: Option\u003cValue\u003e,\n    pub categories: Vec\u003cString\u003e,\n    pub send_at: Option\u003ci64\u003e,\n}\n\npub struct Personalization {\n    pub to: Vec\u003cEmailAddress\u003e,\n    pub cc: Option\u003cVec\u003cEmailAddress\u003e\u003e,\n    pub bcc: Option\u003cVec\u003cEmailAddress\u003e\u003e,\n    pub substitutions: Option\u003cHashMap\u003cString, String\u003e\u003e,\n    pub dynamic_template_data: Option\u003cValue\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n## Agent Use Cases\n\n### Notification Delivery\n- Alert emails for agent events\n- Status update notifications\n- Error/exception reports\n-

Use this as a reference when creating or reviewing connector beads.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Connector Definition (NORMATIVE)\n\n### Required Fields\nEvery connector MUST define:\n- `id: ConnectorId` — Unique identifier (canonical: lowercase ASCII, `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._:-]*$`)\n- `name: String` — Human-readable name\n- `version: Version` — Semantic version\n- `format: ConnectorFormat` — Native or WASI\n- `archetypes: Vec\u003cConnectorArchetype\u003e` — From closed set\n- `operations: Vec\u003cOperation\u003e` — All operations provided\n- `events: Vec\u003cEventType\u003e` — Events emitted (if any)\n- `required_caps: Vec\u003cCapabilityId\u003e` — Capabilities connector requires\n- `optional_caps: Vec\u003cCapabilityId\u003e` — Optional capabilities\n- `forbidden_caps: Vec\u003cCapabilityId\u003e` — Capabilities connector must NOT have\n\n### ConnectorArchetype (Closed Set)\n```rust\npub enum ConnectorArchetype {\n    Bidirectional, // Sends and receives messages\n    Streaming,     // Emits events (read-only)\n    Operational,   // Executes operations (write)\n    Storage,       // Stores/retrieves data\n    Knowledge,     // Provides knowledge/search\n}\n```\n\n### ConnectorFormat (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\npub enum ConnectorFormat {\n    Native, // Requires OS-level sandboxing (seccomp, landlock, AppArmor)\n    Wasi,   // RECOMMENDED for high-risk connectors (financial, credentials, external API)\n}\n```\n\n**Guidance:**\n- WASI format SHOULD be used for SafetyTier::Dangerous operations\n- WASI provides memory isolation, capability-gated hostcalls, cross-platform consistency\n\n---\n\n## 2. Connector State Model (NORMATIVE)\n\n### State Model Declaration\nEvery connector MUST declare one:\n```rust\npub enum ConnectorStateModel {\n    Stateless,           // No mesh-persisted state\n    SingletonWriter,     // Exactly one writer via Lease\n    Crdt { crdt_type },  // Multi-writer via CRDT (rare; justify)\n}\n```\n\n### State Persistence Rules\n- Connectors with polling/cursors/dedup caches MUST externalize state to mesh\n- Local `$CONNECTOR_STATE` is cache only\n- Authoritative state lives as mesh objects\n- Single-writer connectors MUST use Lease for fencing\n\n### Fork Detection (NORMATIVE for singleton_writer)\n- Two `ConnectorStateObject` with same `prev` = SAFETY INCIDENT\n- MUST pause connector execution\n- MUST log fork event for audit\n\n---\n\n## 3. Zone Architecture (NORMATIVE)\n\n### Single-Zone Binding\n- Connector instance MUST bind to exactly ONE zone\n- Cross-zone access requires explicit policy\n\n### Standard Zone Hierarchy\n```\nz:owner         → Full owner access\nz:private       → Personal data\nz:work          → Work services\nz:project:\u003cname\u003e→ Per-project isolation\nz:community     → Semi-trusted communities\nz:public        → Public/untrusted inputs\n```\n\n### Zone Rules\n1. Default deny — If capability not granted to zone, impossible to invoke\n2. No cross-connector calling — All composition through Gateway\n\n---\n\n## 4.

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-e3i9","title":"TEST: E2E Connector Verification Framework","description":"# TEST: E2E Connector Verification Framework (FCP2)\n\n\n## Goal\nBuild the shared E2E connector verification framework that runs connectors through static+dynamic compliance and produces evidence bundles.\n\n## Overview\nEnd-to-end testing framework that verifies **connector implementations** against the **FCP V2-only** platform contract.\n\nThis framework is where we catch \"it compiles but violates the protocol/security model\" failures.\n\n## What this must validate (high-level)\n- Connectors implement the standard method surface (`--manifest`, handshake/describe/introspect/capabilities/configure/invoke/health/shutdown).\n- Connectors are **single-zone bound** for their lifetime.\n- Default deny is mechanical: no capability token → denial + DecisionReceipt.\n- Side effects are safe: OperationIntent/Receipt (and leases where required) prevent duplicate execution.\n- Secrets and PII do not leak to logs.\n\n## Test Scenarios\n\n### Protocol Compliance (FCP2)\n- [ ] Session handshake flow (`MeshSessionHello`/`MeshSessionAck`) success/failure cases\n- [ ] FCPC control-plane framing (ordered, backpressured, canonical object payloads)\n- [ ] FCPS data-plane frames (frame parsing, MAC verification, per-symbol AEAD)\n- [ ] Canonical encoding validation (schema-hash prefix + deterministic CBOR)\n\n### Capability \u0026 Authority\n- [ ] COSE_Sign1 CapabilityToken validation\n- [ ] Expired token rejection\n- [ ] Invalid signature rejection\n- [ ] `grant_object_ids` subset verification\n- [ ] Revocation freshness enforcement (Strict/Warn/BestEffort per policy)\n\n### Lifecycle Tests\n- [ ] Cold start performance (\u003c 50ms target)\n- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling\n- [ ] Crash recovery and restart policy behavior\n- [ ] Health check responses\n\n### Operations \u0026 Events\n- [ ] Introspection accuracy (schemas, risk tiers, hints)\n- [ ] Request/response matching\n- [ ] Streaming/event subscription lifecycle (if connector declares Streaming/Bidirectional)\n- [ ] Cursor-based replay semantics (if connector supports replay)\n\n### Security Boundary Tests\n- [ ] Cross-zone access blocked (must fail closed)\n- [ ] NetworkConstraints enforced (no raw sockets in strict/moderate)\n- [ ] Timeout enforcement\n- [ ] Rate limit compliance (connector and/or platform)\n\n## Test Harness\n\n### MockExternalService\n- Configurable response patterns\n- Latency injection\n- Error injection\n- Rate limit simulation\n- Authentication verification\n\n### ConnectorRunner\n- Spawn connector in subprocess (or run as WASI module)\n- FCPC/FCPS transport shim\n- Output capture (stdout/stderr/logs)\n- Resource monitoring (memory, CPU)\n- Timeout enforcement\n\n### Assertions\n- Protocol message validation via canonical CBOR + schema hash\n- Performance assertions\n- Security assertions\n- DecisionReceipt assertions (reason_code + evidence)\n\n## Logging \u0026 Reporting (REQUIRED)\n- Structured JSON logs for each test\n- Performance metrics collection\n- Test result summary\n- CI integration (JUnit XML or similar)\n\n### Required log fields\n- `timestamp`, `test_name`, `phase`, `correlation_id`, `duration_ms`\n- When applicable: `connector_id`, `operation_id`, `zone_id`, `session_id`\n- For denials: `decision=deny`, `reason_code`, `evidence` (object IDs)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Uses fcp-testkit (mock infrastructure)\n- Depends on core platform conformance artifacts (golden vectors, fuzz harness)\n\n## Execution\n```bash\n# Run E2E tests for specific connector\ncargo test --package fcp-e2e --features telegram\n\n# Run full E2E suite\ncargo test --package fcp-e2e\n\n# Generate report\ncargo test --package fcp-e2e -- --report=json \u003e e2e-results.json\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Runs deterministically in CI (no flake due to timing/network).\n- Uses mocks only (no

Enables agents to manage deployments, investigate pod issues, scale services, and automate DevOps workflows. Essential for cloud-native operations.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Specialized Investment (Infrastructure + High Complexity)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 3 Enterprise (weeks 9-12)\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Workload Management\n- Deploy and update applications\n- Scale deployments\n- Rollback deployments\n- Restart pods\n\n###

Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Grafana/Datadog Integration\n**Full observability stack:**\n- K8s metrics via Prometheus\n- Pod logs via Loki/Datadog\n- Container traces\n- Agent correlates infrastructure state with metrics\n\n### Sentry Integration\n- Link crashes to pod restarts\n- Correlate errors with deployments\n- Resource exhaustion → error patterns\n\n### GitHub Integration\n**GitOps workflows:**\n- Git changes → K8s manifests\n- ArgoCD/Flux integration\n- Deployment tracking\n\n### Terraform Integration\n- Cluster infrastructure via Terraform\n- Workloads via Kubernetes connector\n- Full infrastructure automation\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Incident alerts → agent investigation\n- Deployment coordination\n- On-call handoff workflows\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Core API** — Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets\n- **Apps API** — Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets\n- **Batch API** — Jobs, CronJobs\n- **Networking API** — Ingress, NetworkPolicies\n\n### Authentication Modes\n| Mode | Use Case |\n|------|----------|\n| Kubeconfig | Local/development |\n| ServiceAccount | In-cluster |\n| OIDC | Enterprise SSO |\n| Cloud Provider | EKS/GKE/AKS auth |\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `kube` — Kubernetes client for Rust\n- `k8s-openapi` — Type-safe K8s API bindings\n- `tokio` — Async runtime\n\n### Resource Hierarchy\n```\nNamespace\n├── Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet\n│   └── ReplicaSet\n│       └── Pod\n│           └── Container\n├── Service\n├── ConfigMap\n├── Secret\n└── Ingress\n```\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:infra:k8s:full` | Full cluster access | All operations |\n| `z:infra:k8s:readonly` | Read-only | Queries and logs |\n| `z:infra:k8s:namespace:\u003cname\u003e` | Namespace-scoped | Single namespace |\n| `z:infra:k8s:deploy` | Deployment only | Scale, rollback |\n\n### Safety Tiers\n- **Read**: Logs, status, events — low risk\n- **Deploy**: Scale, rollback — moderate risk\n- **Write**: Apply manifests — high risk\n- **Exec**: Container access — very high risk\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — API operations\n- `streaming` — Watch events, log streaming\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nVaries by deployment:\n- In-cluster: `kubernetes.default.svc:443`\n- Cloud: EKS/GKE/AKS API endpoints\n- Self-hosted: configured API server\n\n### Credential Injection\n- Kubeconfig via file reference\n- ServiceAccount token via mounted secret\n- Cloud credentials via `CredentialId`\n- Never write credentials to disk\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `k8s.pods.read` — List/get pods\n- `k8s.pods.logs` — Stream logs\n- `k8s.deployments.read` — Deployment status\n- `k8s.events.read` — Cluster events\n- `k8s.services.read` — Service info\n- `k8s.configmaps.read` — Config data\n- `k8s.secrets.read` — Secret metadata (not values by default)\n\n### Write Operations\n- `k8s.deployments.scale` — Scale replicas\n- `k8s.deployments.rollback` — Rollback version\n- `k8s.pods.delete` — Restart pods\n- `k8s.configmaps.write` — Update configs\n\n### Administrative (Dangerous)\n- `k8s.manifests.apply` — Apply arbitrary YAML\n- `k8s.pods.exec` — Execute in container\n- `k8s.secrets.values` — Read secret values\n- `k8s.namespaces.delete` — Delete namespace\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### List Pods\n```rust\nlet pods: Api\u003cPod\u003e = Api::namespaced(client, \"production\");\nlet list = pods.list(\u0026ListParams::default()).await?;\n```\n\n### Get Pod Logs\n```rust\nlet pods: Api\u003cPod\u003e = Api::namespaced(client, \"production\");\nlet logs = pods.logs(\"api-pod-abc123\", \u0026LogParams {\n    container: Some(\"api\".into()),\n    tail_lines: Some(100),\n    ..Default::default()\n}).await?;\n```\n\n### Scale Deployment\n```rust\nlet deployments: Api\u003cDeployment\u003e = Api::namespaced(client, \"production\");\nlet patch = json!({\n    \"spec\": {\n        \"replicas\": 5\n    }\n});\ndeployments.patch_scale(\"api\", \u0026PatchParams::default(), \u0026Patch::Merge(\u0026patch)).await?;\n```\n\n### Watch Events\n```rust\nlet events: Api\u003cEvent\u003e = Api::all(client);\nlet watcher = watcher(events, Config::default());\n// Stream events as they occur\n```\n\n---\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\n### Blast Radius Control\n- Prefer namespace-scoped access\n- Avoid cluster-admin by default\n- Rate limit write operations\n\n### Sensitive Operations\n| Operation | Risk | Mitigation |\n|-----------|------|------------|\n| `exec` | Very High | Disabled by default, audit all uses |\n| `delete namespace` | High | Require explicit confirmation |\n| `apply manifest` | Medium | Validate against schema |\n| `read secrets` | Medium | Mask values, log access |\n\n### Audit Requirements\n- All K8s API calls logged\n- Secret access specially flagged\n- exec sessions recorded\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- API request construction\n- Resource type handling\n- Watch event parsing\n- Log streaming\n\n### Integration Tests\n- k3s or kind for local cluster simulation\n- Namespace isolation scenarios\n- RBAC enforcement testing\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints\n- RBAC boundaries respected\n- Audit logging for all operations\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real cluster calls in unit tests\n- Pod listing and logs functional\n- Deployment scale/rollback works\n- Event watching operational\n- Namespace isolation enforced\n- Proper RBAC integration\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Connector epic is fully decomposed into implementable beads (manifest/cap map, provisioning, operations, tests, E2E compliance).\n- All child beads are implemented and closed, and the connector passes the mechanical compliance runner + its E2E scenarios with structured JSON logs.\n- Mechanical guarantees hold: single-zone binding, default-deny capabilities, and NetworkConstraints enforcement; no secret/PII leakage in logs.\n\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:42:32.498324635-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:57:26.33647367-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.651756068-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.676831995-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-9co","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.914416549-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:32:29.76288918-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:12.416732313-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:12.649003357-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:12.87401208-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:13.103222077-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:13.337736959-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-gxx2","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:27:13.560287951-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-heeq","title":"Threshold Secrets (Shamir Secret Sharing)","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement cryptographic threshold secret sharing using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSS) over GF(2^8) as mandated by V2 spec §17.3. This is a DISTINCT system from RaptorQ symbol distribution - secrets use real cryptographic secret sharing because RaptorQ symbols can leak structure.\n\n## Background \u0026 Justification\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nThe V2 spec explicitly states: \"Secrets use real cryptographic secret sharing (Shamir), not just RaptorQ symbols. RaptorQ symbols are NOT a secret sharing scheme—a single symbol can leak structure.\"\n\nKey differences from RaptorQ:\n- RaptorQ symbols can leak structure (not semantically secure)\n- Single RaptorQ symbol may reveal partial information\n- Shamir shares reveal NOTHING until k shares collected\n- Wrapped shares ensure a node cannot decrypt other nodes' shares\n\n**Design Philosophy:**\n\"Secrets are never complete anywhere\" - the secret is only reconstructed ephemerally during use and immediately zeroized. No single device ever stores the complete secret.\n\n## Normative Types (V2 Spec §17.3)\n\n### SecretObject\n```rust\npub struct SecretObject {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    pub secret_id: SecretId,        // Unique identifier\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,            // Zone binding\n    pub k: u8,                      // Threshold (need k shares)\n    pub n: u8,                      // Total shares distributed\n    pub scheme: SecretSharingScheme,\n    pub wrapped_shares: HashMap\u003cTailscaleNodeId, Vec\u003cu8\u003e\u003e,\n    pub rotation: SecretRotationPolicy,\n}\n```\n\n### SecretSharingScheme\n```rust\npub enum SecretSharingScheme {\n    ShamirGf256,  // Shamir's Secret Sharing over GF(2^8)\n}\n```\n\n### SecretRotationPolicy\n```rust\npub struct SecretRotationPolicy {\n    pub rotate_after_secs: u64,    // Auto-rotate interval\n    pub overlap_secs: u64,         // Both old and new valid\n}\n```\n\n### SecretAccessToken\n```rust\npub struct SecretAccessToken {\n    pub jti: Uuid,                  // Unique token ID\n    pub secret_id: SecretId,        // Which secret\n    pub purpose: String,            // For audit trail\n    pub requested_by: PrincipalId,  // Requester identity\n    pub iat: u64,                   // Issued at\n    pub exp: u64,                   // Expires at (short-lived!)\n    pub signature: Signature,       // Approver signature\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### 1. Shamir Secret Sharing Implementation\n- Implement Shamir SSS over GF(2^8) with constant-time operations\n- Support configurable k-of-n thresholds\n- Each share MUST be wrapped (encrypted) so nodes cannot decrypt other nodes' shares\n- Use per-node Tailscale keys for share wrapping\n\n### 2. SecretObject Management\n- Create/store secrets with proper threshold configuration\n- Distribute wrapped shares to mesh peers\n- Track share locations for reconstruction\n- Implement zone-scoped access control\n\n### 3. Secret Reconstruction (Ephemeral)\n```rust\nimpl SecretObject {\n    pub async fn use_secret\u003cF, R\u003e(\u0026self, access_token: \u0026SecretAccessToken, f: F) -\u003e Result\u003cR\u003e\n    where F: FnOnce(\u0026[u8]) -\u003e R\n    {\n        // 1. Verify access token\n        access_token.verify()?;\n        \n        // 2. Create audit event BEFORE reconstruction\n        self.audit_secret_access(access_token).await?;\n        \n        // 3. Collect k wrapped shares from peers\n        let shares = self.collect_k_wrapped_shares(access_token).await?;\n        \n        // 4. Reconstruct using Shamir\n        let secret = reconstruct_shamir_secure(\u0026shares)?;\n        \n        // 5. Execute closure with ephemeral secret\n        let result = f(\u0026secret);\n        \n        // 6. Zeroize IMMEDIATELY after use\n        secure_zero(secret);\n        \n        Ok(result)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. SecretAccessToken Workflow\n- Token issuance requires owner or delegated approver signature\n- Tokens MUST be short-lived (minutes, not hours)\n- Purpose field required for audit trail\n- Verify before any secret operation\n\n### 5. Secret Rotation\n- Implement automatic rotation based on SecretRotationPolicy\n- Support overlap period where both old and new secrets valid\n- Coordinate rotation across mesh peers\n- Maintain audit trail of rotation events\n\n### 6. Integration with Credentials\nThe CredentialObject (§10.4) references secrets via SecretId:\n- CredentialObject.secret_ref: Option\u003cSecretId\u003e\n- Secret materialization requires SecretAccessToken\n- Audit every secret access for credential injection\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Constant-time operations**: All Shamir math MUST be constant-time to prevent timing attacks\n2. **Zeroization**: Use zeroize crate; secrets never persist in memory longer than closure execution\n3. **Share isolation**: Wrapped shares use per-node keys; compromise of one node doesn't leak other shares\n4. **Audit trail**: Every secret access creates AuditEvent BEFORE reconstruction\n5. **Token validation**: SecretAccessToken signature and expiry verified before any operation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Shamir GF(2^8) implementation with constant-time polynomial evaluation\n- [ ] SecretObject with k-of-n threshold configuration\n- [ ] Per-node share wrapping using Tailscale node keys\n- [ ] SecretAccessToken creation and validation\n- [ ] Ephemeral reconstruction with immediate zeroization\n- [ ] SecretRotationPolicy with overlap period support\n- [ ] Integration with CredentialObject for secret-backed credentials\n- [ ] Comprehensive audit events for all secret operations\n- [ ] Unit tests for Shamir math, threshold edge cases, rotation\n- [ ] Integration tests for multi-node secret reconstruction\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis feature depends on:\n- Core Types (ObjectHeader, ZoneId, etc.)\n- Zone Architecture (zone-scoped access)\n- Capability System (for SecretAccessToken authorization)\n- MeshNode (for peer share collection)\n- Observability (for audit events)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:41:27.758361051-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T04:47:20.445243106-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T04:47:20.445243106-05:00","close_reason":"Duplicate of 6o25.1 (enhanced with detailed V2 spec content)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-heeq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:41:52.710979314-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-heeq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.17","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:42:48.351360458-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-heeq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.28","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:42:49.218849666-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

Direct integration enables seamless human↔agent task handoff and creates the bridge between \"human project management\" and \"agent task execution.\" This is the task coordination backbone.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Strategic Investment (High Value + Moderate Effort)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 1 Foundation (immediate)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec\\![\n    ConnectorArchetype::Operational,\n    ConnectorArchetype::Streaming,\n    ConnectorArchetype::Bidirectional\n]\n```\n- **Operational**: GraphQL CRUD operations\n- **Streaming**: Webhook event ingestion\n- **Bidirectional**: If Beads↔Linear sync implemented\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::SingletonWriter\n```\n- **SingletonWriter**: Required for bidirectional sync and webhook dedupe\n- State tracked: `{ sync_cursor: Option\u003cSyncToken\u003e, webhook_event_ids: Vec\u003cEventId\u003e }`\n- Lease required for writer fencing during sync operations\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Wasi\n```\n- **WASI recommended**: External API connector with OAuth credentials\n- Memory isolation prevents token extraction\n- Cross-platform consistent behavior\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n

Risky | Public communication |\n| `linear.webhooks.manage` | Dangerous | Inbound vector config |\n| `linear.beads.sync` | Dangerous | Bidirectional data sync |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Issue Management\n- Full issue CRUD with metadata (priority, labels, assignees)\n- Comment threads and discussions\n- Label and status automation\n- Team workload visibility\n- Sprint/cycle management\n\n### Project \u0026 Roadmap\n- Project and roadmap access\n- Milestone tracking\n- Team capacity planning\n- Cross-project dependency tracking\n\n### Webhook Events\n- Real-time event processing for automation triggers\n- Status change notifications\n- Assignment alerts\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Create a Linear issue for this bug I found\"\n\"Whats blocking the current sprint?\"\n\"Assign this task to the frontend team\"\n\"Update issue status when PR is merged\"\n\"Generate weekly sprint summary\"\n\"Auto-triage incoming issues using BV algorithms\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### BV (Beads Viewer) — Bidirectional Sync\n**This is the killer feature.**\n- Linear issues ↔ Beads (agent-native tasks)\n- Sync status, priority, and dependencies bidirectionally\n- Use BV's graph algorithms for Linear triage:\n  - PageRank for issue importance\n  - Critical path analysis\n  - Blocker detection\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Auto-assign issues based on file reservations\n- Route issue updates as mail notifications\n- Thread Linear comments with agent discussions\n\n### NTM (Neural Task Manager)\n- Spawn agents for Linear issues automatically\n- Break down Linear epics into agent-executable subtasks\n- Report progress back to Linear\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- Link code sessions to Linear issues\n- Semantic search across issue history\n- Learn from resolution patterns\n\n### UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)\n- Create Linear issues from UBS findings automatically\n- Link bug reports to specific code locations\n- Track fix status through issue lifecycle\n\n---\n\n## Automation Unlocks\n\n### Auto-Triage Pipeline\n```\nUBS finding → Create Linear issue → BV ranks priority → Agent Mail assigns → Agent works → PR links back\n```\n\n### Implementation Plan Generation\n```\nLinear issue description → Agent generates implementation plan → Creates subtasks → Links to codebase\n```\n\n### Status Sync\n```\nGit commit → Linked issue → Update Linear status → Notify stakeholders\n```\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **GraphQL API** with full query/mutation support\n- **Subscription support** for real-time updates (optional)\n- **Webhook handler** for event-driven automation\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `graphql_client` or `cynic` — GraphQL client\n- `reqwest` — HTTP transport\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `tokio` — Async runtime\n\n### Bidirectional Beads Sync Protocol\nIf enabled, this is a high-risk side effect requiring:\n- Explicit capability token\n- OperationIntent/Receipt to avoid duplicate writes\n- AuditEvents for every sync operation\n- Stable reason codes on denials\n- Conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins or manual)\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:work:linear:\u003cworkspace\u003e` | Full workspace access | All CRUD operations |\n| `z:project:\u003cname\u003e:linear` | Project-scoped access | Issues in specific project |\n| `z:work:linear:readonly` | Read-only monitoring | List/get only |\n\n### Single-Zone Binding\n- One connector instance binds to exactly one `ZoneId`\n- Cross-workspace sync requires separate instances\n- Beads sync is per-zone; cannot sync across workspaces\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — GraphQL CRUD operations\n- `streaming` — Webhook/event ingestion (if enabled)\n- `bidirectional` — If Beads↔Linear sync implemented\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `api.linear.app:443`\n- `linear.app:443` (OAuth flows)\n\n### Credential Injection\n- API key via `CredentialId` (simpler, personal use)\n- OAuth token via `CredentialId` (team/workspace access)\n- Never write credentials to disk\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `linear.issues.read` — List, get, search issues\n- `linear.comments.read` — Read issue comments\n- `linear.projects.read` — List projects, roadmaps\n- `linear.teams.read` — Team information\n- `linear.users.read` — User profiles\n\n### Write Operations\n- `linear.issues.write` — Create, update, move, assign\n- `linear.comments.write` — Create, update, delete comments\n- `linear.projects.write` — Modify project settings\n- `linear.labels.write` — Manage labels\n\n### Dangerous Operations\n- `linear.webhooks.manage` — Webhook configuration\n- `linear.beads.sync` — Bidirectional Beads sync (if enabled)\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Issue Operations\n- `issue.create` — Create new issue\n- `issue.update` — Update issue fields\n- `issue.get` — Get issue by ID\n- `issue.list` — List issues with filters\n- `issue.search` — Full-text search\n- `issue.move` — Move between projects/teams\n- `issue.assign` — Assign to user\n- `issue.relations` — Manage issue relationships\n\n### Comment Operations\n- `comment.create` — Add comment to issue\n- `comment.update` — Edit comment\n- `comment.delete` — Remove comment\n- `comment.list` — List issue comments\n\n### Project/Cycle Operations\n- `project.list` — List projects\n- `project.get` — Get project details\n- `cycle.list` — List sprints/cycles\n- `cycle.get` — Get cycle details\n\n### Optional: Beads Sync\n- `beads.sync.pull` — Import Linear issues to Beads\n- `beads.sync.push` — Export Beads to Linear\n- `beads.sync.bidirectional` — Full two-way sync\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- GraphQL query construction\n- Response parsing\n- Sync conflict resolution logic\n- Rate limit handling\n\n### Integration Tests\n- wiremock-based GraphQL simulation\n- Webhook event simulation\n- Bidirectional sync scenarios\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates default deny + NetworkConstraints\n- Verifies receipts for write

Broad data access |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Messaging Operations\n- Send/update/delete messages\n- React with emoji\n- Reply in threads\n- Schedule messages\n\n### Channel Management\n- List/create channels\n- Archive/rename channels\n- Set topic/purpose\n- Manage membership\n\n### User Information\n- List workspace users\n- Get user profiles\n- Check presence status\n\n### File Operations\n- Upload/download files\n- Share files in channels\n- List file history\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Post a summary in #team-updates\"\n\"Reply to this thread with the analysis\"\n\"Create a channel for this project\"\n\"Search for messages about the deployment\"\n\"Upload this report to #reports\"\n\"Notify @oncall about the incident\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Slack threads ↔ Agent Mail threads\n- Cross-platform notifications\n- Unified conversation history\n\n### GitHub/Linear Integration\n- PR/issue notifications to channels\n- Command-triggered workflows\n- Status updates on commits\n\n### Sentry/Datadog Integration\n- Alerts routed to Slack\n- Incident channels auto-created\n- On-call notifications\n\n### HubSpot Integration\n- Deal updates in sales channels\n- Customer mentions trigger CRM lookup\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Web API**: CRUD operations\n- **Socket Mode**: Real-time events (recommended)\n- **Events API**: Webhook-based events (fallback)\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `slack_morphism` — Slack API client\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client\n- `tokio-tungstenite` — WebSocket for Socket Mode\n- `hmac` / `sha2` — Request signing\n\n### Authentication Modes\n| Mode | Use Case | Recommendation |\n|------|----------|----------------|\n| Bot Token | Standard automation | **Preferred** |\n| User Token | User-delegated access | Limited use |\n| App-Level Token | Socket Mode | Required for events |\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:work:slack:\u003cworkspace\u003e` | Workspace-scoped | Full workspace access |\n| `z:work:slack:readonly` | Read-only | Safe operations only |\n| `z:project:\u003cname\u003e:slack` | Channel-scoped | Limited channels |\n\n### Threat Model\n- Slack messages are adversarial prompt surfaces\n- DMs contain sensitive enterprise data\n- No token/PII leakage in logs\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `bidirectional` — Send + receive messages\n- `streaming` — Real-time event ingestion\n- `operational` — Web API actions\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `api.slack.com:443`\n- `files.slack.com:443`\n- `wss-primary.slack.com:443` (Socket Mode)\n\n### Credential Injection\n- Bot token via egress proxy\n- App-level token for Socket Mode\n- Signing secret for Events API\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `slack.messages.read` — Read messages\n- `slack.channels.read` — List channels\n- `slack.users.read` — User info (PII)\n- `slack.files.read` — File access\n\n### Write Operations\n- `slack.messages.send` — Post messages\n- `slack.channels.write` — Create/modify channels\n- `slack.files.write` — Upload files\n\n### Admin Operations\n- `slack.search.read` — Workspace-wide search (Dangerous)\n- `slack.interactive.manage` — Modals/actions (Dangerous)\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Post Message\n```json\nPOST /chat.postMessage\n{\n  \"channel\": \"C1234567890\",\n  \"text\": \"Hello from the agent\\!\",\n  \"thread_ts\": \"1234567890.123456\"\n}\n```\n\n### List Channels\n```\nGET /conversations.list?types=public_channel,private_channel\n```\n\n### Get User Info\n```\nGET /users.info?user=U1234567890\n```\n\n### Upload File\n```\nPOST /files.upload\n(multipart form with file + channel)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- API request construction\n- Response parsing\n- Socket Mode event handling\n- Rate limit handling\n- Signing verification\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock Slack API responses\n- Multi-step workflows\n- Socket Mode connection simulation\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints\n- Dangerous operation approval flow\n- Audit logging for writes\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real Slack API calls in unit tests\n- Socket Mode connection functional\n- All message operations work\n- Channel CRUD functional\n- File upload/download works\n- All V2 NORMATIVE requirements

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-i4zm","title":"Revocation System (RevocationObject/Registry/Chain)","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement the revocation system as specified in V2 spec §14.3. This is CRITICAL security infrastructure - the spec explicitly states: \"Without revocation, 'compromised device' recovery is mostly imaginary.\"\n\nRevocations are mesh objects distributed like any other object and MUST be enforced before use.\n\n## Background \u0026 Justification\n\nWhen a device is compromised or a key is leaked, the mesh MUST be able to:\n1. Revoke capabilities issued to that device\n2. Revoke the device's issuer key (can no longer mint tokens)\n3. Remove the device from the mesh entirely\n4. Revoke compromised connector binaries\n5. Force zone key rotation\n\nWithout revocation, security incidents cannot be recovered from.\n\n## Normative Types (V2 Spec §14.3)\n\n### RevocationObject\n```rust\npub struct RevocationObject {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    /// ObjectIds being revoked\n    pub revoked: Vec\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n    /// Scope of revocation\n    pub scope: RevocationScope,\n    /// Human-readable reason\n    pub reason: String,\n    /// When revocation becomes effective\n    pub effective_at: u64,\n    /// Optional expiry (None = permanent)\n    pub expires_at: Option\u003cu64\u003e,\n    /// Owner signature (revocations MUST be owner-signed)\n    pub signature: Signature,\n}\n```\n\n### RevocationScope\n```rust\npub enum RevocationScope {\n    /// Revoke capability objects/tokens\n    Capability,\n    /// Revoke issuer keys (node can no longer mint tokens)\n    IssuerKey,\n    /// Revoke node attestation (removes device from mesh)\n    NodeAttestation,\n    /// Revoke zone key (forces rotation)\n    ZoneKey,\n    /// Revoke connector binary (supply chain response)\n    ConnectorBinary,\n}\n```\n\n### RevocationEvent (Chain Node)\n```rust\n/// Hash-linked chain for revocation freshness\npub struct RevocationEvent {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    pub revocation_object_id: ObjectId,\n    pub prev: Option\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n    /// Monotonic chain sequence number (NORMATIVE)\n    /// Enables O(1) freshness comparison: seq_a \u003e seq_b ⟹ a is fresher than b\n    pub seq: u64,\n    pub occurred_at: u64,\n    pub signature: Signature,\n}\n```\n\n### RevocationHead (Checkpoint)\n```rust\n/// Enables freshness semantics: tokens bound to a rev_head, verifiers MUST\n/// have revocation state \u003e= that head before accepting the token\npub struct RevocationHead {\n    pub header: ObjectHeader,\n    pub zone_id: ZoneId,\n    pub head_event: ObjectId,\n    /// Sequence number of head_event (NORMATIVE)\n    /// Enables O(1) freshness comparison without chain traversal\n    pub head_seq: u64,\n    pub epoch_id: EpochId,\n    pub quorum_signatures: Vec\u003c(TailscaleNodeId, Signature)\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### RevocationRegistry\n```rust\npub struct RevocationRegistry {\n    revocations: HashMap\u003cObjectId, RevocationObject\u003e,\n    bloom_filter: BloomFilter,  // Fast negative lookup\n    /// Latest revocation head known for this zone\n    pub head: Option\u003cObjectId\u003e,\n}\n\nimpl RevocationRegistry {\n    /// Check if object is revoked (MUST be called before use)\n    pub fn is_revoked(\u0026self, object_id: \u0026ObjectId) -\u003e bool {\n        // Fast path: bloom filter definitely-not check\n        if !self.bloom_filter.might_contain(object_id.as_bytes()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        self.revocations.contains_key(object_id)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### 1. RevocationObject Creation and Signing\n- Owner-only signing (revocations are critical operations)\n- Support all RevocationScope variants\n- Validate effective_at is in future or now\n- Propagate via mesh gossip immediately\n\n### 2. RevocationEvent Chain\n- Hash-linked for integrity\n- Monotonic seq for O(1) freshness comparison\n- Each new revocation creates new chain node\n- Support chain traversal for full audit\n\n### 3. RevocationHead Quorum\n- Requires quorum signatures from mesh nodes\n- Binds capability tokens to revocation state\n- Verifiers MUST check token.rev_head \u003c= local.head\n- Enables freshness guarantees\n\n### 4. Bloom Filter Optimization\n- Fast negative lookup for non-revoked objects\n- Size tuned for expected revocation volume\n- Rebuild on restart from persistent store\n\n### 5. Revocation Enforcement Points\n\nEVERY capability verification MUST include:\n```rust\nfn verify_capability_token(\u0026self, token: \u0026CapabilityToken) -\u003e Result\u003c()\u003e {\n    // MANDATORY: Check revocation before any other validation\n    if self.revocation_registry.is_revoked(\u0026token.object_id) {\n        return Err(Error::Revoked);\n    }\n    \n    // Check revocation freshness\n    if let Some(token_rev_head) = token.rev_head {\n        if !self.revocation_registry.is_at_least(token_rev_head)? {\n            return Err(Error::RevocationStateStale);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Continue with normal verification...\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Revocation Propagation\n- High-priority gossip (revocations supersede other traffic)\n- Persist to local store immediately\n- Trigger re-evaluation of cached capability decisions\n\n## Use Cases by Scope\n\n### Capability Revocation\n- Revoke specific capability tokens (e.g., leaked token)\n- Immediate effect on all nodes\n\n### IssuerKey Revocation  \n- Node can no longer mint new tokens\n- Existing tokens remain valid until they expire\n- Used for semi-trusted devices\n\n### NodeAttestation Revocation\n- Complete device removal from mesh\n- All capabilities issued TO and BY this node revoked\n- Used for compromised devices\n\n### ZoneKey Revocation\n- Forces zone key rotation\n- All zone members must re-enroll\n- Used for catastrophic key compromise\n\n### ConnectorBinary Revocation\n- Specific binary hash revoked\n- Connectors using that binary MUST stop\n- Used for supply chain incidents\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] RevocationObject with all scope variants\n- [ ] Owner-only signature validation\n- [ ] RevocationEvent hash-linked chain\n- [ ] Monotonic seq numbers for O(1) freshness\n- [ ] RevocationHead with quorum signatures\n- [ ] RevocationRegistry with bloom filter\n- [ ] is_revoked() check at all enforcement points\n- [ ] Revocation freshness comparison\n- [ ] High-priority gossip propagation\n- [ ] Persistent storage with crash recovery\n- [ ] Audit events for all revocation operations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Core Types (ObjectHeader, ObjectId, etc.)\n- Zone Architecture (zone-scoped revocations)\n- Capability System (enforcement points)\n- MeshNode (gossip propagation)\n- Observability (audit events)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:25.848323653-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T04:47:20.691101782-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T04:47:20.691101782-05:00","close_reason":"Duplicate of 1n78.9 (enhanced with detailed V2 spec content)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-i4zm","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:35.262322521-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-i4zm","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:35.503327279-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-i4zm","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.17","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:35.752827498-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-i4zm","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.28","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:36.0081018-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-imi","title":"fcp.browser - Headless Browser Automation Connector","description":"# fcp.browser - Headless Browser Automation Connector (FCP2)\n\n## Strategic Context\n\n### Value Assessment\n**Strategic Value Score: 95/100** — Critical Tier 1 meta-connector.\n\n**Why Critical**: This is the **\"UNIVERSAL ADAPTER\"** that lets agents interact with ANY web service, even those without APIs. Combined with vision models, this enables true general-purpose web automation. When there is no API, the browser connector is the fallback.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Strategic Investment (High Value + Foundation)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 1 Foundation (immediate)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec\\![ConnectorArchetype::Operational]\n```\n- **Operational**: Navigates, extracts, interacts with web pages\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::SingletonWriter\n```\n- **SingletonWriter**: Browser session state, cookies, auth tokens\n- State tracked: `{ session_id: String, cookies: CookieJar, auth_state: Option\u003cAuthState\u003e }`\n- Lease required for session fencing\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Native\n```\n- **Native MANDATORY**: Requires OS-level process spawning for browser\n- Sandboxed via seccomp/landlock\n- Browser runs in separate process sandbox\n- Note: WASI does not support browser automation\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n    // DYNAMIC: host_allow populated from policy allowlist\n    host_allow: vec\\![/* policy-defined allowlist */],\n    port_allow: vec\\![80, 443],\n    deny_localhost: true,\n    deny_private_ranges: true,\n    deny_tailnet_ranges: true,\n    deny_ip_literals: true,\n    require_sni: true,\n    require_host_canonicalization: true,\n}\n```\n**Note**: Browser navigation is ONLY permitted to explicitly allowlisted hosts.\n\n### TaintFlags (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n// ALL web content is adversarial\npage_content.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::PUBLIC_INPUT\n    | TaintFlags::EXTERNAL_INPUT\n    | TaintFlags::PROMPT_SURFACE\n    | TaintFlags::UNVERIFIED_LINK;\n\n// Form inputs submitted by agent\nform_data.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::USER_SUPPLIED;\n\n// Extracted data inherits source taint\nextracted_data.provenance.taint = page_content.provenance.taint;\n```\n\n### SafetyTier per Operation\n| Operation | SafetyTier | Rationale |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| `browser.navigate` | Risky | Visits external sites |\n| `browser.screenshot` | Safe | Read-only capture |\n| `browser.extract` | Safe | Read-only extraction |\n| `browser.click` | Risky | Triggers actions |\n| `browser.fill` | Risky | Submits data |\n| `browser.submit` | Dangerous | Form submission |\n| `browser.authenticate` | Dangerous | Credential handling |\n| `browser.execute_js` | Dangerous | Arbitrary code execution |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Universal Web Access\n- Navigate any allowlisted website\n- Fill forms and submit data\n- Extract structured data (scraping)\n- Handle authentication flows\n- Screenshot and visual verification\n- PDF generation from web pages\n\n### Automation Superpowers\n- **Covers EVERY service without a dedicated connector**\n- Handles legacy systems with only web UI\n- Enables agents to do anything a human can do online\n- Future-proof: works with any new website automatically\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Log into this legacy system and export the report\"\n\"Fill out this government form with the provided data\"\n\"Screenshot the competitor pricing page daily\"\n\"Extract product data from this e-commerce site\"\n\"Complete this multi-step web workflow\"\n\"Check if this website is accessible\"\n\"Generate PDF invoice from this web portal\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### ALL Other Connectors\n**Universal fallback:**\n- When no API exists, use browser\n- Legacy system integration\n- Complex web workflows\n\n### Google AI/Vision Integration\n- Screenshot → vision model analysis\n- Visual understanding of pages\n- Layout comprehension\n\n### Vector DB Integration\n- Scraped content → embeddings\n- Web page indexing\n- Content similarity search\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Web form results → agent threads\n- Screenshot reports\n- Workflow status notifications\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### Architecture\n```\nFCP Connector\n      ↓\nBrowser Controller\n      ↓\nChromium/Playwright\n      ↓\nWeb (allowlisted hosts only)\n```\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `chromiumoxide` — Chrome DevTools Protocol\n- `fantoccini` — WebDriver client\n- `headless_chrome` — Chrome automation\n- `image` — Screenshot handling\n\n### Browser Options\n| Engine | Recommendation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| Chromium | **Preferred** |\n| Firefox | Supported |\n| WebKit | Limited support |\n\n### Security Hardening\n- Browser runs with minimal permissions\n- No extension installation\n- Disk access disabled\n- Network restricted to allowlist\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:web:browser:allowlist` | Allowlisted sites | Navigate + extract |\n| `z:web:browser:auth` | Auth-enabled | Can handle login |\n| `z:web:browser:restricted` | Minimal | Screenshot only |\n\n### Security Considerations\n- EVERY navigated URL is adversarial\n- Content extraction requires sanitization\n- Form submission is high-risk\n- JavaScript execution is DANGEROUS\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — Web interactions\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; DYNAMIC allowlist:\n- Policy specifies permitted hosts\n- No implicit wildcards\n- Subdomain matching explicit\n\n### Credential Injection\n- Site credentials via egress proxy\n- Session cookies managed securely\n- Never persist login state\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Navigation Operations\n- `browser.navigate` — Load URL (allowlisted)\n- `browser.back` / `browser.forward` — History navigation\n- `browser.refresh` — Reload page\n\n### Extraction Operations\n- `browser.screenshot` — Capture page\n- `browser.extract` — DOM extraction\n- `browser.pdf` — Generate PDF\n\n### Interaction Operations\n- `browser.click` — Click element\n- `browser.fill` — Fill form field\n- `browser.submit` — Submit form (Dangerous)\n- `browser.authenticate` — Login flow (Dangerous)\n\n### Advanced Operations\n- `browser.execute_js` — Run JavaScript (Dangerous)\n- `browser.wait` — Wait for condition\n- `browser.scroll` — Scroll page\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Navigate to URL\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"browser.navigate\",\n  \"url\": \"https://allowlisted-site.com/page\",\n  \"wait_for\": \"networkidle\"\n}\n```\n\n### Take Screenshot\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"browser.screenshot\",\n  \"selector\": \"#main-content\",\n  \"format\": \"png\",\n  \"full_page\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Extract Data\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"browser.extract\",\n  \"selectors\": {\n    \"title\": \"h1.title\",\n    \"price\": \".price-value\",\n    \"description\": \".product-desc\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Fill Form\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"browser.fill\",\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\"selector\": \"#email\", \"value\": \"test@example.com\"},\n    {\"selector\": \"#message\", \"value\": \"Hello\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Command serialization\n- Response parsing\n- Selector validation\n- Allowlist enforcement\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock browser responses\n- Multi-step navigation\n- Form interaction simulation\n- Error handling\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints (allowlist only)\n- Dangerous operation approval flow\n- Content taint propagation\n- Audit logging\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real web navigation in unit tests\n- URL allowlist enforced\n- Screenshot capture functional\n- DOM extraction works\n- Form filling works\n- JavaScript execution requires approval\n- All V2 NORMATIVE requirements

The highest leverage DX improvement is a generator that enforces:\n- single-zone binding,\n- default-deny NetworkConstraints,\n- secretless operation by default (no secrets on disk; no logging secrets),\n- structured JSON logging,\n- unit test + E2E scaffolding,\n- and a clear “what you must fill in” checklist.\n\nThis command is **developer tooling**. It must not weaken production security assumptions.\n\n## Scope\nIn scope:\n- Create a new connector crate with a minimal-but-correct FCP2 skeleton.\n- Emit a default manifest with placeholder capabilities, sandbox profile, and NetworkConstraints.\n- Emit placeholder operations and the correct receipts / error taxonomy wiring.\n- Create deterministic unit test scaffolding and an E2E script skeleton.\n- Run mechanical validation checks and print actionable diagnostics.\n\nOut of scope:\n- Any compatibility shim for legacy FCP1 protocols.\n- Generating real credentials or storing secrets.\n\n## Command UX (proposal)\n\n### Basic usage\n```bash\nfcp new fcp.myservice\n```\n\n### Optional flags\n- `--archetype request-response|streaming|bidirectional|polling|webhook|queue|file|database|cli|browser`\n- `--zone z:project:\u003cname\u003e` (default: `z:project:default` or prompt)\n- `--no-e2e` (if generating only unit test scaffolding)\n- `--dry-run` (print planned files without writing)\n- `--check` (validate an existing connector directory)\n\n### Outputs\n- Prints:\n  - created file list\n  - next steps\n  - compliance precheck results (pass/fail with reasons)\n- Supports `--json` output like the rest of `fcp-cli`.\n\n## Skeleton contents (must generate)\n\n### 1) Cargo crate\n- Path: `connectors/\u003cname\u003e/`\n- Library crate (or bin, depending on repo conventions) with:\n  - minimal `Cargo.toml`\n  - dependency on `fcp-sdk`\n  - `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`\n\n### 2) Manifest\nGenerate an initial FCP2 manifest that is:\n- syntactically valid TOML\n- references:\n  - connector id\n  - version\n  - zone binding (single-zone)\n  - capabilities list\n  - sandbox profile\n  - NetworkConstraints (default deny)\n\n### 3) Operations + schemas\n- Provide placeholder operations that demonstrate:\n  - typed input/output schemas\n  - error taxonomy usage (FCP-XXXX)\n  - receipt emission\n  - tracing fields (`correlation_id`, `zone_id`, `connector_id`, `operation_id`)\n\n### 4) Tests\n- Unit test scaffold:\n  - a “happy path” operation test using a mock transport\n  - negative tests for missing capability / denied NetworkConstraints\n  - redaction test: assert secrets are never logged\n\n- E2E scaffold:\n  - a script or harness integration that:\n    - installs the connector\n    - invokes an operation\n    - verifies DecisionReceipt / AuditEvent shape\n    - exercises default-deny failure path\n\n## Mechanical prechecks (must run)\nAt creation time (and for `--check`), run:\n- Manifest validation\n- Connector compliance checklist (structure + fields)\n- NetworkConstraints default-deny invariant\n- “no secrets on disk” lint (no examples with plaintext tokens)\n\nThese checks should reuse the platform’s mechanical compliance runner where possible.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `fcp new \u003cname\u003e` creates a connector skeleton that builds in the workspace.\n- Generated connector starts V2-only and includes no FCP1 language or compatibility shims.\n- Generated manifest includes single-zone binding + default-deny NetworkConstraints.\n- Generated tests include at least:\n  -

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-kt9r","title":"[FCP2] Credential Injection: SecretObject + CredentialObject + Secretless Egress (Zeroize)","description":"# [FCP2] Credential Injection: SecretObject + CredentialObject + Secretless Egress (Zeroize)\n\n## Goal\nDefine how credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, webhook secrets, database passwords, client certs) flow to connectors in a way that is:\n- mechanically capability-gated\n- single-zone bound\n- audited and explainable\n- secret-safe (no disk; no logs; prefer no plaintext in connector memory)\n\n## Why this is MVP\nConnectors cannot do useful work without credentials, and credentials are one of the highest-value compromise targets. If we get this wrong, every connector becomes an exfiltration vector.\n\nThis bead defines the *platform contract* for credential access, so connector authors can implement auth once and rely on mechanical enforcement.\n\n## NORMATIVE object model (Spec + `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md`)\n\n### 1) `SecretObject` + `SecretAccessToken`\n- Secrets are stored/represented as mesh objects (`SecretObject`).\n- Using/reconstructing a secret requires an explicit, short-lived authorization (`SecretAccessToken`).\n- Every successful access MUST emit an `AuditEvent` (e.g., `event_type = \"secret.access\"`) and MUST NOT include secret bytes.\n- Secret material MUST be zeroized immediately after use.\n\nNote: Threshold secrets (k-of-n) and wrapped shares are part of the spec security model. Even if we ship a simplified MVP path, the *interfaces* must not preclude threshold reconstruction.\n\n### 2) `CredentialObject` + `CredentialId` (\"secretless\" by default)\nA `CredentialObject` is a zone-bound, auditable handle describing *how to apply* a secret to outbound traffic:\n- maps `CredentialId` -\u003e `SecretId`\n- defines application method (e.g., HTTP header format)\n- optionally binds allowed hosts for defense-in-depth\n\nConnectors SHOULD NOT receive raw credential bytes. They should reference a `CredentialId` in egress requests and rely on MeshNode enforcement.\n\n### 3) Capability constraints: `credential_allow`\nCapabilities grant *permission to use credentials* by listing allowed `CredentialId`s:\n- `CapabilityConstraints.credential_allow` is the authoritative allow-list.\n- Credential permissions are checked at the boundary (egress proxy / host), not by connector convention.\n\n## Preferred flow: secretless credential injection via MeshNode egress proxy\n1. Connector prepares an `EgressHttpRequest` (or `EgressTcpConnectRequest`) and sets `credential = Some(CredentialId)`.\n2. Egress proxy verifies ALL of the following:\n   - `CredentialId` ∈ invoking capability’s `credential_allow`\n   - destination host/port conforms to `NetworkConstraints`\n   - destination host is allowed by the referenced `CredentialObject.host_allow` (when present)\n   - policy allows the operation’s safety tier in this zone (fail closed)\n3. Proxy fetches/validates the referenced `CredentialObject` and `SecretObject` and injects credential material at the network boundary.\n4. Proxy emits an `AuditEvent` describing usage (credential id, host, purpose) without any secret bytes.\n\nThis yields \"secretless connectors\" where plaintext credentials never enter connector memory.\n\n## When secret materialization is unavoidable (explicit, audited, bounded)\nSome connectors may need to sign payloads locally (HMAC), perform mTLS client auth, or interact with non-proxied libraries.\n\nIn these cases:\n- The connector (or host on its behalf) must obtain a `SecretAccessToken`.\n- Reconstruction/use must be short-lived and bounded.\n- Every materialization MUST be audited.\n- Dangerous operations MUST require explicit ApprovalToken policy (and emit DecisionReceipt on deny).\n- Secret bytes MUST be zeroized on all paths, including errors and panics.\n\n## Manifest / schema integration requirements\n- Credential IDs MUST NOT be encoded inside capability IDs.\n- Operations that need credentials must require a capability whose constraints include the needed `CredentialId` in `credential_allow`.\n- If credentials are host-bound, host canonicalization rules MUST match the NetworkConstraints canonicalization rules.\n\n## Tests (owned by `flywheel_connectors-nnja`)\n- Unit: `CredentialObject` validation (format, host binding, canonicalization)\n- Unit: `credential_allow` enforcement logic (allow/deny)\n- Integration: egress proxy injection (header injection, deny wrong host, deny missing `credential_allow`)\n- Adversarial: prove connectors cannot obtain secret bytes unless explicitly granted and audited\n- Audit: `secret.access` events emitted with redaction guarantees\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Secretless credential injection works end-to-end with mechanical enforcement at the boundary.\n- No secrets touch disk; no secret bytes appear in logs or error messages.\n- Unauthorized credential use fails closed with a DecisionReceipt and evidence.\n- Secret materialization (when required) is explicit, audited, short-lived, and zeroized.\n","notes":"Core types implemented: SecretObject, SecretId, SecretAccessToken, SecretMaterial (with zeroize), CredentialObject, CredentialId, CredentialApplication variants, hex_or_bytes_vec serde helper.

Without scheduling, agents are purely reactive. With cron, agents become proactive and can handle recurring tasks autonomously.\n\n### Meta-Connector Category\nThis is a **Meta-Connector** — it provides scheduling infrastructure that enhances the capabilities of all other connectors. Rather than connecting to an external service, it provides time-based triggering.\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Foundation Infrastructure\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 1 Foundation (immediate)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec![ConnectorArchetype::Operational]\n```\n- **Operational**: Executes scheduled operations (write pattern)\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::SingletonWriter\n```\n- **SingletonWriter**: Schedule state requires single-writer for consistency\n- State tracked: `{ schedules: Vec\u003cSchedule\u003e, execution_history: Vec\u003cExecution\u003e }`\n- Lease required to prevent duplicate schedule executions\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Wasi\n```\n- **WASI recommended**: Schedule execution involves capability-gated actions\n- Memory isolation prevents schedule manipulation\n- Cross-platform consistent scheduling behavior\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n    // Cron is internal infrastructure - no external egress\n    host_allow: vec![],\n    port_allow: vec![],\n    deny_localhost: true,\n    deny_private_ranges: true,\n    deny_tailnet_ranges: true,\n    deny_ip_literals: true,\n    require_sni: false,\n    require_host_canonicalization: true,\n}\n```\nNote: Triggered actions use their own connector's NetworkConstraints.\n\n### TaintFlags (NORMATIVE)\nScheduled actions are **internally sourced** but may have tainted inputs:\n```rust\n// Schedule definitions from admin are trusted\nschedule_definition.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::NONE;\n\n// But if schedule parameters come from external input:\nif schedule.params_source == External {\n    execution.provenance.taint |= TaintFlags::EXTERNAL_INPUT;\n}\n```\n\n### SafetyTier per Operation\n| Operation | SafetyTier | Rationale |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n|

Time-Based Triggers\n- Periodic data syncs\n- Regular health checks\n- Scheduled reports\n- Maintenance windows\n\n### Job Execution\n- Execute scheduled actions\n- Handle missed schedules\n- Retry failed executions\n- Track execution history\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Run backups every night at 2am\"\n\"Check for new emails every 5 minutes\"\n\"Generate weekly reports on Monday 9am\"\n\"Sync data every hour\"\n\"Send reminders 1 day before deadlines\"\n\"Archive old logs monthly\"\n\"Rotate credentials quarterly\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### ALL Other Connectors\n**Universal scheduling layer:**\n- Schedule any connector operation\n- Periodic polling where webhooks unavailable\n- Batch operations during off-hours\n\n### Agent Mail

Core Components\n1. **Schedule Store**: Persistent schedule definitions\n2. **Scheduler**: Triggers jobs at scheduled times\n3. **Executor**: Runs scheduled actions\n4. **History**: Tracks execution results\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `cron` — Cron expression parsing\n- `chrono` — DateTime handling\n- `tokio` — Async runtime and timers\n- `sled` or `sqlite` — Schedule persistence\n\n### Cron

Tests\n- End-to-end scheduling\n- Multi-schedule scenarios\n- History tracking\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Execution limits enforced\n- Audit logging\n- Resource controls\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- Cron expressions parse correctly\n- Schedules trigger on time\n- Missed execution handling works\n- History tracking functional\n-

Direct, optimized access to AI providers is **infrastructure, not just another integration**. Anthropic (Claude) is a leading model provider with unique capabilities (large context, tool use, vision).\n\n### Priority Matrix Position\n- **Category**: Strategic Investment (High Value + Foundation)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 1 Foundation (immediate)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec\\![ConnectorArchetype::Operational, ConnectorArchetype::Streaming]\n```\n- **Operational**: Standard request/response chat completions\n- **Streaming**: SSE streaming for real-time token delivery\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::Stateless\n```\n- **Stateless**: No mesh-persisted state needed\n- Each request is independent\n- No cursor/dedupe/polling state\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Wasi\n```\n- **WASI recommended**: External API connector with credential handling\n- Memory isolation for API key safety\n- Cross-platform consistent behavior\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n    host_allow: vec\\![\"api.anthropic.com\".into()],\n    port_allow: vec\\![443],\n    deny_localhost: true,\n    deny_private_ranges: true,\n    deny_tailnet_ranges: true,\n    deny_ip_literals: true,\n    require_sni: true,\n    require_host_canonicalization: true,\n}\n```\n\n### TaintFlags (NORMATIVE)\nAI model outputs carry provenance metadata:\n```rust\n// Model outputs are internally generated but may contain:\nmodel_output.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::NONE;\n\n// If output contains URLs from training data:\nif output.contains_urls {\n    model_output.provenance.taint |= TaintFlags::UNVERIFIED_LINK;\n}\n\n// Outputs that will be shown to users:\nif output.is_prompt_surface {\n    model_output.provenance.taint |= TaintFlags::PROMPT_SURFACE;\n}\n```\n\n### SafetyTier per Operation\n| Operation | SafetyTier | Rationale |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| `anthropic.messages.create` | Safe | Read-only generation |\n| `anthropic.messages.stream` | Safe | Read-only streaming |\n| `anthropic.batch.create` | Risky | Resource-intensive |\n| `anthropic.tools.use` | Risky | May trigger side effects |\n| `anthropic.models.opus` | Risky | High-cost model |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Core AI Operations\n- Messages API with streaming support\n- Tool use / function calling\n- Vision (images in prompts)\n- Prompt caching for efficiency\n- Batch API for bulk processing\n\n### Meta-Agent Patterns\n- Agents spawning sub-agents with Claude\n- Model-specific optimization (use Haiku for simple tasks)\n- Fallback chains to other providers\n- Cost tracking and budget enforcement\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Analyze this image and describe what you see\"\n\"Generate code for this specification\"\n\"Summarize these documents using Claude\"\n\"Use Claude to evaluate this PR\"\n\"Spawn a sub-agent with Haiku for quick classification\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### LLM Router Integration\n- Part of the `fcp.llm-router` meta-connector strategy\n- Intelligent model selection based on task\n- Cost-based routing (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus)\n- Latency-based routing for real-time needs\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- Use Claude for semantic understanding\n- Generate embeddings for search (when available)\n- Intelligent re-ranking of search results\n\n### Agent Mail\n- Claude-powered message summarization\n- Intelligent routing of messages to agents\n- Natural language understanding of requests\n\n### All Other Connectors\n- Claude can help interpret/process data from any connector\n- Vision model can understand screenshots from browser connector\n- Document understanding from file connectors\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Messages API** — Primary interface for chat completions\n- **Streaming** — Server-Sent Events for real-time responses\n- **Tool Use** — Function calling for structured outputs\n- **Vision** — Image inputs in messages\n- **Prompt Caching** — Cache system prompts for efficiency\n- **Batch API** — Bulk processing at lower cost\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client with streaming support\n- `eventsource-stream` / `async-sse` — SSE parsing\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `base64` — Image encoding\n\n### Streaming Implementation\n```rust\n// SSE stream handling pattern\nlet stream = client.post(url)\n    .header(\"Accept\", \"text/event-stream\")\n    .send_stream();\n\nfor event in stream {\n    match event.event_type {\n        \"message_start\" =\u003e // Handle start\n        \"content_block_delta\" =\u003e // Handle token\n        \"message_stop\" =\u003e // Handle completion\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Cost Tracking\n- Track input/output tokens per request\n- Emit usage metrics for policy/billing\n- Support budget caps at zone level\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:ai:anthropic:full` | Full model access | All models, all operations |\n| `z:ai:anthropic:opus` | Opus access only | Opus model |\n| `z:ai:anthropic:sonnet` | Sonnet access | Sonnet model |\n| `z:ai:anthropic:haiku` | Haiku access | Haiku model (cost-effective) |\n\n### Cost Control via Zones\n- Zone policy can enforce model restrictions\n- Budget caps per zone\n- Rate limits per zone\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — Standard request/response\n- `streaming` — SSE streaming responses\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `api.anthropic.com:443`\n\n### Credential Injection\n- API key via `CredentialObject`/`CredentialId`\n- Egress proxy injection preferred\n- Never write keys to disk; never log them\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Generation\n- `anthropic.messages.create` — Non-streaming completion\n- `anthropic.messages.stream` — Streaming completion\n- `anthropic.batch.create` — Batch processing\n\n### Model Access (Tiered)\n- `anthropic.models.opus` — Access to Opus\n- `anthropic.models.sonnet` — Access to Sonnet\n- `anthropic.models.haiku` — Access to Haiku\n\n### Features\n- `anthropic.tools.use` — Tool/function calling\n- `anthropic.vision.use` — Image inputs\n- `anthropic.cache.use` — Prompt caching\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Messages API\n- `messages.create` — Standard completion\n- `messages.stream` — Streaming completion\n\n### Parameters\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n  \"max_tokens\": 4096,\n  \"messages\": [...],\n  \"tools\": [...],        // Optional tool definitions\n  \"system\": \"...\",       // System prompt\n  \"stream\": true         // Enable streaming\n}\n```\n\n### Tool Use Flow\n1. Define tools in request\n2. Model may return `tool_use` content blocks\n3. Execute tools, return `tool_result`\n4. Model continues with tool results\n\n### Vision Flow\n1. Include image in message content\n2. Use `image` content block with base64 or URL\n3. Model processes image alongside text\n\n---\n\n## Safety + Retries\n\n### Timeout Management\n- All operations have bounded timeouts\n- Streaming has heartbeat timeout\n- Long-running requests can be cancelled\n\n### Rate Limits\n- Respect `retry-after` headers\n- Implement exponential backoff\n- Never retry blindly\n\n### Side Effects\n- AI completions are generally idempotent\n- Tool use may have side effects — handle with OperationIntent/Receipt\n- Fail closed on uncertain outcomes\n\n---\n\n## Provenance \u0026 Taint\n\n### Output Tainting\n- Model outputs must carry provenance metadata\n- Policy can govern downstream use of AI-generated content\n- Enable \"AI-generated\" labeling workflows\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- API request construction\n- Response parsing (streaming and non-streaming)\n- Tool use flow\n- Error handling\n\n### Integration Tests\n- wiremock-based API simulation\n- Deterministic SSE simulation\n- Token counting verification\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates default deny + NetworkConstraints\n- Usage metrics emitted correctly\n- No secret leakage\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real Anthropic calls in unit tests\n- Streaming works correctly\n- Tool use functions properly\n- Vision inputs processed\n- Usage metrics emitted accurately\n- Cost tracking functional\n- All V2 NORMATIVE requirements satisfied","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:35:11.109729231-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:56:53.20943321-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier1"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:35:11.155109125-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.03841551-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.122321037-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.209523004-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.297465155-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.393748701-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk.4","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:24:31.478345369-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

reveals presence patterns\n- Energy data reveals behavior\n\n### Rate Limiting\n- Local API generally unlimited\n- Don't spam device commands\n- Respect device response times\n\n---\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit Tests (Mock-Only)\n- Service call construction\n- State parsing\n- Entity ID validation\n- WebSocket message handling\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Mock Home Assistant server\n- State change scenarios\n- Service call verification\n\n### E2E Compliance\n- Validates NetworkConstraints\n- Security operation logging\n- Audit trail for all commands\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Passes connector compliance runner (static + dynamic)\n- No real HA calls in unit tests\n- State reading works\n- Service calls functional\n- WebSocket subscription works\n- Security operations require confirmation\n- Proper entity ID validation\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Connector epic is fully decomposed into implementable beads (manifest/cap map, provisioning, operations, tests, E2E compliance).\n- All child beads are implemented and closed, and the connector passes the mechanical compliance runner + its E2E scenarios with structured JSON logs.\n- Mechanical guarantees hold: single-zone binding, default-deny capabilities, and NetworkConstraints enforcement; no secret/PII leakage in logs.\n\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T21:47:23.753034524-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:57:25.773534634-05:00","labels":["connectors","fcp2","tier3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.755440392-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.781430691-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-9co","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:10.941417791-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T02:33:08.184119911-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:21.771059529-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:21.987697973-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:22.19857324-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:22.410084214-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:22.632010851-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ortf","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:25:22.844831703-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

**Category**: Strategic Investment (High Value + Communication Infrastructure)\n- **Build Phase**: Phase 2 Productivity (weeks 5-8)\n\n---\n\n## V2 Specification Compliance (NORMATIVE)\n\n### ConnectorArchetype\n```rust\narchetypes: vec\\![\n    ConnectorArchetype::Bidirectional,  // Send/receive messages\n    ConnectorArchetype::Operational,    // Call initiation, config\n    ConnectorArchetype::Streaming,      // Webhook events\n]\n```\n- **Bidirectional**: SMS/WhatsApp send and receive\n- **Operational**: Voice calls, TwiML, phone numbers\n- **Streaming**: Webhooks for delivery status, inbound messages\n\n### ConnectorStateModel\n```rust\nstate_model: ConnectorStateModel::SingletonWriter\n```\n- **SingletonWriter**: Message delivery tracking, call state\n- State tracked: `{ pending_messages: HashMap\u003cMessageSid, Status\u003e, call_state: HashMap\u003cCallSid, CallState\u003e }`\n- Lease required for writer fencing\n\n### ConnectorFormat\n```rust\nformat: ConnectorFormat::Wasi\n```\n- **WASI recommended**: Handles API credentials, PII (phone numbers)\n- Memory isolation for credential protection\n- Capability-gated hostcalls\n\n### NetworkConstraints (NORMATIVE)\n```rust\nNetworkConstraints {\n    // Twilio API endpoints\n    host_allow: vec\\![\n        \"api.twilio.com\".into(),\n        \"verify.twilio.com\".into(),\n

(NORMATIVE)\n```rust\n// Inbound messages are external/adversarial\ninbound_message.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::EXTERNAL_INPUT\n    | TaintFlags::PROMPT_SURFACE\n    | TaintFlags::USER_SUPPLIED;\n\n// Phone numbers are PII - handle carefully\nphone_number.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::USER_SUPPLIED;\n\n// Outbound content may contain user data\noutbound_message.provenance.taint = TaintFlags::USER_SUPPLIED;\n```\n\n### SafetyTier per Operation\n| Operation | SafetyTier | Rationale |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| `twilio.messages.read` | Risky | Contains PII |\n| `twilio.calls.read` | Risky | Call history |\n| `twilio.lookups.phone` | Risky | Phone number info |\n| `twilio.messages.send` | Dangerous | External communication |\n| `twilio.calls.initiate` | Dangerous | Real-world call |\n| `twilio.verify.send` | Dangerous | Sends verification |\n| `twilio.numbers.purchase` | Dangerous | Financial transaction |\n| `twilio.numbers.release` | Dangerous | Releases resource |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### SMS Operations\n- Send individual and bulk SMS messages\n- Receive and process inbound SMS\n- MMS with media attachments\n- Short code and toll-free support\n\n### Voice Calls\n- Initiate outbound calls\n- TwiML for call flow control\n- Conference calling\n- Call recording and transcription\n\n### WhatsApp Business\n- Send template messages\n- Handle conversations\n- Media messages\n\n### Verification\n- Send verification codes\n- Phone number validation\n- 2FA support\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Send an SMS alert to the on-call engineer\"\n\"Notify customers about their order status\"\n\"Initiate a call to this number\"\n\"Verify this phone number\"\n\"Send a WhatsApp message with the invoice\"\n\"Check delivery status of sent messages\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Stripe Integration\n**Payment

Hard-coding a “pricing model” table in a connector/spec becomes incorrect quickly.\n\n### What we track instead (stable)\n- provider-reported usage fields (when present)\n- token counts (input/output/cache)\n- image counts/size classes\n- audio seconds\n\n### Budget enforcement\nBudgets can be enforced in two stable ways:\n1. **Usage budgets** (preferred): token/image/second limits per request/session/day.\n2. **Currency budgets** (optional): computed by an external, versioned “pricing catalog” object owned by policy/ops (not embedded in the connector).\n\n### Attribution\n- Track usage per agent\n- Track usage per task/session\n- Track usage per operation/tool\n- Generate reports\n\n## Prompt Caching Strategy\n- System prompts \u003e 1024 tokens: Always cache\n- Tool definitions: Cache when \u003e 5 tools\n- Large documents: Cache with TTL\n- Cache warming on connector init\n\n## Error Handling\n- Rate limit (429): Exponential backoff\n- Overloaded (529): Queue and retry\n- Invalid request (400): Parse and report\n- Auth failure (401): Refresh credentials\n- Context length exceeded: Truncation strategy\n\n## Dependencies\n- anthropic-rs or custom HTTP client\n- reqwest (HTTP)\n- tokio (async)\n- serde (serialization)\n- async-stream (streaming)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Send basic message and receive response\n- [ ] Stream response tokens in real-time\n- [ ] Use tools in conversation\n- [ ] Process images in prompts\n- [ ] Submit and retrieve batch jobs\n- [ ] Track usage accurately per request\n- [ ] Enforce budget limits\n- [ ] Handle rate limits gracefully\n- [ ] Utilize prompt caching\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:11:55.294212353-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T04:55:46.932938692-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-11T10:42:07.614456761-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented Anthropic Claude API connector with Messages API, streaming support, cost tracking, and unit tests","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ptr","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:43:18.580791794-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ptr","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-iv7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:43:18.616615002-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ptr","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:43:18.65424983-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-ptr","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-9co","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:43:18.687755696-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Research \u0026 Knowledge Extraction\n- Video metadata extraction and search\n- **Transcript retrieval** (auto-generated + manual captions)\n- Video summarization via transcript\n- Topic research across video content\n\n### Channel Management\n- Channel analytics and insights\n- Video upload and publish automation\n- Comment management and moderation\n- Playlist management\n\n### Content Discovery\n- Search videos by topic, channel, or criteria\n- Find relevant tutorials and explanations\n- Monitor competitor channels\n- Track trending content\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"Summarize this YouTube video\" → Fetch transcript → Process\n\"Find videos about {topic}\" → Search + metadata extraction\n\"What are people saying about this video?\" → Comment analysis\n\"Monitor competitor channels for new content\"\n\"Schedule video posts\" → Content calendar management\n\"Extract code examples from this tutorial video\"\n\"What are the key points from this conference talk?\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- Index video transcripts\n- Semantic video search\n- Knowledge graph from video content\n\n### Google AI/Gemini Integration\n- Native video understanding\n- Multimodal analysis\n- Long video processing\n\n### Vector DB Integration\n- Transcript embeddings\n- Video similarity search\n- Topic clustering\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Video notifications → agent threads\n- Content updates\n- Research findings\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **YouTube Data API v3**: Primary interface\n- **YouTube Analytics API**: Channel insights\n- **YouTube Reporting API**: Bulk data\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `google-youtube3` — YouTube API client\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client\n- `serde_json` — JSON handling\n- `tokio` — Async runtime\n\n### Quota Management\nYouTube API has strict quotas:\n```rust\nQuotaLimits {\n    daily_quota: 10000,  // Units per day\n    // search.list: 100 units\n    // videos.list: 1 unit\n    // captions.download: 200 units\n    // videos.insert: 1600 units\n}\n```\n\n### Authentication\n| Mode | Use Case |\n|------|----------|\n| API Key | Public data (search, metadata) |\n| OAuth2 | Private data, uploads |\n| Service Account | Server-to-server |\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:media:youtube:full` | Full access | All operations |\n| `z:media:youtube:read` | Read-only | Search, metadata, transcripts |\n| `z:media:youtube:manage` | Management | Upload, update, delete |\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Quota exhaustion is a concern\n- Public content creation is high-risk\n- Comments are adversarial\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `knowledge` — Video/transcript search\n- `operational` — Channel management\n\n---\n\n## External Surface\n\n### NetworkConstraints\nDefault-deny; allow only:\n- `www.googleapis.com:443`\n- `youtube.googleapis.com:443`\n- `upload.youtube.com:443`\n\n### Credential Injection\n- API key via egress proxy (public data)\n- OAuth2 tokens via CredentialId\n- Never persist credentials\n\n---\n\n## Capability Model\n\n### Read Operations\n- `youtube.videos.search` — Search videos\n- `youtube.videos.get` — Video metadata\n- `youtube.captions.get` — Transcripts\n- `youtube.channels.get` — Channel info\n- `youtube.playlists.get` — Playlist info\n\n### Write Operations\n- `youtube.videos.upload` — Upload video (Dangerous)\n- `youtube.videos.update` — Update metadata (Dangerous)\n- `youtube.playlists.write` — Manage playlists\n- `youtube.comments.write` — Post comments (Dangerous)\n\n### Admin Operations\n- `youtube.videos.delete` — Delete video (Dangerous)\n- `youtube.channels.update` — Channel settings (Dangerous)\n\n---\n\n## Operations (Representative)\n\n### Search Videos\n```\nGET /youtube/v3/search?part=snippet\u0026q={query}\u0026type=video\n```\n\n### Get Video Details\n```\nGET /youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet,contentDetails\u0026id={video_id}\n```\n\n### Get Captions/Transcript\n```\nGET /youtube/v3/captions?part=snippet\u0026videoId={video_id}\nGET

automation with strict capabilities and webhook ingestion.\n\nFlywheel Connector Protocol implementation for Trello - the popular kanban board platform for project management and team collaboration.\n\n## External surface (NetworkConstraints)\nDefault deny.\n- Network egress MUST be restricted per-operation via manifest `NetworkConstraints` (defined in the connector’s manifest/cap map bead if present).\n- Allow only the configured service host(s); HTTPS-only where applicable; deny redirects by default.\n- Bound timeouts + response sizes; treat all remote responses as untrusted input; never leak secrets/PII in logs or errors.\n\n## Manifest archetypes (closed set)\n\n- `operational`\n- `streaming`\n\n\u003e Interaction patterns (non-archetype): Request/Response + Webhook\n\n## Overview\n\n- **Value Score**: 63/100 (Tier 4)\n- **Archetype**: Request-Response + Webhook\n- **Platform**: Trello REST API\n- **Model**: Simple kanban (boards, lists, cards)\n\n## Operations\n\n### Board Management\n- Create, read, update, delete boards\n- Board settings and preferences\n- Board backgrounds and power-ups\n- Board templates\n\n### List Management\n- Create, read, update, archive lists\n- List positioning and ordering\n- Move lists between boards\n\n### Card Operations (CRUD)\n- Create, read, update, delete cards\n- Card positioning within lists\n- Move cards between lists/boards\n- Card due dates and reminders\n- Card cover images\n\n### Checklists\n- Create, read, update, delete checklists\n- Checklist items management\n- Item completion tracking\n- Copy checklists between cards\n\n### Labels\n- Create, read, update, delete labels\n- Assign/remove labels from cards\n- Custom label colors and names\n\n### Attachments\n- Upload attachments to cards\n- Link external URLs\n- Delete attachments\n- Attachment previews\n\n### Members\n- List board members\n- Add/remove members from boards\n- Assign/unassign members to cards\n- Member permissions\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n\u003c!-- fcp2-single-zone-note --\u003e\n**FCP2 single-zone binding note:** A connector instance binds to exactly one `ZoneId` for its entire lifetime.\nThe *\"zones\"* described in this section are a **recommended deployment pattern** (run separate connector instances in separate zones with different capability grants/policies) and/or conceptual risk tiers.\nThe connector MUST NOT multiplex multiple zones internally.\n\n\n### Zone: board_read\n- Read board details and settings\n- List boards for user\n- Read lists and list positions\n- Read cards and card details\n- Read checklists and items\n- Read labels and attachments\n- Read member information\n\n### Zone: card_write\n- Create/update/delete cards\n- Manage card positions\n- Create/update/delete checklists\n- Manage checklist items\n- Add/remove labels from cards\n- Upload/delete attachments\n- Assign/unassign members to cards\n\n### Zone: board_admin\n- Create/update/delete boards\n- Create/update/delete lists\n- Create/update/delete labels\n- Add/remove board members\n- Manage board settings\n- Archive/unarchive boards\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `fcp-core`: Core FCP types and traits\n- `fcp-oauth`: OAuth 1.0a authentication (Trello uses OAuth 1.0a)\n- `fcp-webhook`: Real-time webhook handling for board/card events\n- `fcp-ratelimit`: Rate limiting (Trello: 100 requests/10s per token, 300/10s per key)\n- `fcp-telemetry`: Metrics and tracing\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Authentication\n- OAuth 1.0a flow\n- API Key + Token authentication\n- Token expiration handling\n\n### Rate Limits\n- 100 requests per 10 seconds per token\n- 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key\n- Rate limit headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`\n\n### Webhook Events\n- Card created/updated/deleted\n- Card moved between lists\n- Checklist item completed\n- Member added/removed\n- Board updated\n- List created/archived\n\n### API Considerations\n- Nested resources (board \u003e list \u003e card \u003e checklist)\n- Batch operations support\n- Field selection for response optimization\n- Pagination via `limit` and `before`/`since` parameters\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Core board and list operations\n2. **Phase 2**: Card CRUD and positioning\n3. **Phase 3**: Checklists and labels\n4. **Phase 4**: Attachments and members\n5. **Phase 5**: Webhook integration\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Full board CRUD operations\n- [ ] Complete list management\n- [ ] Card operations with positioning\n- [ ] Checklist and label support\n- [ ] Attachment upload/management\n- [ ] Member management\n- [ ] Webhook event handling\n- [ ] Rate limit compliance\n- [ ] OAuth 1.0a

repo/issues/CI automation with strict capabilities and webhook ingestion.\n\nDevOps platform connector (GitHub alternative) for the GitLab ecosystem.\n\n## External surface (NetworkConstraints)\nDefault deny.\n- Network egress MUST be restricted per-operation via manifest `NetworkConstraints` (defined in the connector’s manifest/cap map bead if present).\n- Allow only the configured service host(s); HTTPS-only where applicable; deny redirects by default.\n- Bound timeouts + response sizes; treat all remote responses as untrusted input; never leak secrets/PII in logs or errors.\n\n## Manifest archetypes (closed set)\n\n- `operational`\n- `streaming`\n\n\u003e Interaction patterns (non-archetype): Request/Response + Webhook\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `fcp.gitlab` connector provides comprehensive integration with GitLab's DevOps platform, enabling repository management, merge request workflows, CI/CD pipeline control, container registry access, and collaboration features.\n\n## Value Assessment\n\n- **Value Score**: 71/100 (Tier 4)\n- **Archetype**: Request-Response + Webhook\n- **Priority**: P3\n\n## Core Operations\n\n### Repository Management\n- Repository CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete/archive)\n- Branch management (create, delete, protect, unprotect)\n- Tag management and release creation\n- Fork operations and upstream sync\n- Repository mirroring configuration\n\n### Merge Request Management\n- MR creation with source/target branch specification\n- Review workflows (approve, unapprove, merge, close, reopen)\n- Inline comments and discussions\n- MR labels, milestones, and assignees\n- Draft/WIP MR handling\n- Merge conflict detection and resolution hints\n- Squash and merge options\n\n### Issue Tracking\n- Issue CRUD with full metadata\n- Labels, milestones, weights, due dates\n- Issue boards and swimlanes\n- Related issues and blocking relationships\n- Time tracking (estimates and spent time)\n- Issue templates\n\n### CI/CD Pipelines\n- Pipeline triggering and cancellation\n- Job management (retry, cancel, play manual jobs)\n- Pipeline schedules\n- Environment deployments\n- Artifact download and browsing\n- Pipeline variables and secrets (scoped)\n- Multi-project pipelines\n- Parent-child pipelines\n\n### Container Registry\n- Image listing and metadata\n- Tag management\n- Image deletion and garbage collection triggers\n- Repository-level registry operations\n\n### Wiki\n- Wiki page CRUD\n- Attachment handling\n- Wiki export\n\n### Snippets\n- Project and personal snippets\n- Multi-file snippet support\n- Snippet versioning\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n\u003c!-- fcp2-single-zone-note --\u003e\n**FCP2 single-zone binding note:** A connector instance binds to exactly one `ZoneId` for its entire lifetime.\nThe *\"zones\"* described in this section are a **recommended deployment pattern** (run separate connector instances in separate zones with different capability grants/policies) and/or conceptual risk tiers.\nThe connector MUST NOT multiplex multiple zones internally.\n\n\n### Zone 1: Code Read\n- Repository metadata and content read\n- Branch and tag listing\n- MR and issue viewing\n- Pipeline status viewing\n- Wiki reading\n- Snippet viewing\n\n### Zone 2: Code Write\n- Repository content modifications\n- Branch and tag creation/deletion\n- MR and issue creation/modification\n- Wiki editing\n- Snippet management\n\n### Zone 3: CI/CD Control\n- Pipeline triggering and management\n- Job control (retry, cancel, play)\n- Environment management\n- Artifact access\n- Registry operations\n\n### Zone 4: Admin\n- Repository settings modification\n- Access level management\n- Webhook configuration\n- Protected branch rules\n- Deploy keys and tokens\n- Group/project transfer\n\n## API Integration\n\n### GitLab REST API v4\n- Primary API for most operations\n- Pagination handling (keyset and offset)\n- Rate limit awareness (429 responses)\n- Personal Access Token and OAuth2 authentication\n\n### GitLab GraphQL API\n- Complex queries with field selection\n- Batch operations\n- Efficient nested data retrieval\n- Mutation support for write operations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **fcp-core**: Base connector traits and types\n- **fcp-oauth**: OAuth2 authentication flow for GitLab\n- **fcp-webhook**: Webhook event handling for GitLab events\n- **fcp-ratelimit**: Rate limiting with GitLab-specific headers\n- **fcp-telemetry**: Observability and metrics\n\n## Webhook Events\n\nSupported GitLab webhook event types:\n- Push events\n- Tag push events\n- Merge request events\n- Issue events\n- Pipeline events\n- Job events\n- Deployment events\n- Wiki page events\n- Note (comment) events\n- Release events\n\n## Authentication Methods\n\n1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Scoped tokens for API access\n2. **OAuth2**: Full OAuth2 flow for user authorization\n3. **CI Job Token**: For pipeline-initiated operations\n4. **Deploy Token**: Read-only access for deployments\n5. **Group/Project Access Token**: Scoped to specific resources\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n- Standard: 2000 requests/minute for authenticated users\n- GraphQL: Complexity-based limiting\n- Retry-After header support\n- Automatic backoff on 429 responses\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n- Support for both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances\n- Configurable base URL for self-hosted\n- API version negotiation\n- Feature flag detection for instance capabilities\n- Graceful degradation for missing features\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Repository CRUD operations functional\n- [ ] MR lifecycle management complete\n- [ ] Issue tracking integration working\n- [ ] Pipeline triggering and monitoring operational\n- [ ] Container registry operations functional\n- [ ] Wiki and snippet support implemented\n- [ ] Webhook event handling for all event types\n- [ ] OAuth2 and PAT authentication

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","title":"Connector Lifecycle Management (Activate/Update/Rollback)","description":"# [FCP2] Connector Lifecycle Management (Activate / Update / Rollback)\n\n## Goal\nImplement connector lifecycle management as specified in Spec V2 §14.1–14.2:\n- secure activation (sandbox + policy + capability gating)\n- staged updates\n- crash-loop detection\n- rollback / pinning\n\nThis bead is **host/orchestrator** behavior (MeshNode / `fcp-host`), not connector-specific code.\n\n## Why This Matters\nConnectors are security-critical binaries that execute with zone-scoped authority. Lifecycle management is where we:\n- prevent “unsigned code ran” incidents\n- enforce sandbox defaults *before* first byte of connector code executes\n- provide safe operations ergonomics (predictable rollback, explainable failures)\n\n## Hard Requirements (V2-only)\n- No FCP1 compatibility paths.\n- Single-zone binding per connector instance.\n- Default deny: a connector cannot perform an operation without a valid CapabilityToken.\n- Fail closed on ambiguous outcomes (esp. during update/rollback).\n\n## Normative Alignment (Spec §14)\n### §14.1 Activation Requirements\nOn activation, MeshNode MUST ensure (in order):\n1. **Supply-chain verification**: manifest+binary verification chain passes (see `flywheel_connectors-1n78.27`).\n2. **Policy ceilings**: requested capabilities/sandbox/network constraints are within zone ceilings (see `flywheel_connectors-1n78.26`).\n3. **Sandbox creation**: OS/WASI sandbox instantiated from manifest profile (see `flywheel_connectors-1n78.18`).\n4. **Credential injection discipline**: secrets never touch disk; secretless-by-default egress injection preferred (see `flywheel_connectors-kt9r`).\n5. **Handshake + readiness**: connector standard method surface is reachable and stable (`handshake`, `health`, etc.).\n6. **Audit**: activation emits an audit event with evidence (manifest id, binary id, policy heads, zone checkpoint).\n\n### §14.2 Updates and Rollback\n- Updates MUST be verifiable and staged (not “swap binary in place blindly”).\n- Crash loops MUST trigger a safe fallback.\n- Owner can pin a known-good version.\n\n## Design / Deliverables\n### A) Connector lifecycle state machine\nA host-visible state machine that drives deterministic behavior:\n\n- NotInstalled\n- Installed (verified artifacts present)\n- Activating (phased)\n- Running (healthy)\n- Unhealthy (recoverable)\n- Failed (crash-loop / policy refusal)\n- RolledBack\n\n### B) Activation workflow\nActivation is phased to make failures diagnosable:\n1. Resolve requested connector version and retrieve artifacts (registry or mesh mirror).\n2. Verify manifest/binary + policy requirements.\n3. Build sandbox profile (fs/network/time/mem/cpu limits) and start connector.\n4. Perform standard method checks:\n   - `--manifest` extractable without execution\n   - `handshake` succeeds\n   - `describe`/`introspect` callable\n5. Register connector instance with the node runtime (zone-bound).\n6. Start health monitor.\n\n### C) Update manager\n- Staged rollout strategy:\n  - canary → expand → full\n  - per-zone policy may require manual approval for risky connectors\n- Version pinning:\n  - per connector + zone\n  - explicit reason + audit event\n\n### D) Crash-loop detection + rollback\nCrashLoopDetector:\n- detects N crashes in M seconds\n- emits audit event with evidence\n- rolls back to last-known-good version if available\n- fails closed if no verified previous version exists\n\nRollback must preserve:\n- revocation enforcement\n- policy ceilings\n- audit trail\n\n### E) Observability and error mapping\n- All lifecycle failures map to FCP error taxonomy (`flywheel_connectors-1n78.29`).\n- Structured logs include:\n  - connector_id, zone_id, version\n  - binary_id + manifest_id\n  - phase + reason_code\n\n## Tests\n- Unit tests: state machine transitions and crash-loop detection.\n- Integration tests: staged update and rollback in deterministic harness.\n- Adversarial tests:\n  - attempt to activate without verification → denied\n  - attempt to activate with policy-incompatible sandbox/network → denied\n  - crash-loop triggers rollback deterministically\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Activation fails closed unless verification + policy checks succeed.\n- Rollback is deterministic and auditable.\n- Crash-loop behavior is tested and produces actionable logs.\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jeff141421@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:43:45.965006161-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:58.303435723-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:33.13230292-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T04:44:33.382523176-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-kt9r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:16.190313834-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.11","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:16.43773218-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.27","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:16.679456611-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.29","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:16.922428233-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:17.163210537-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:17.422344032-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-y1q8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T05:39:21.947158308-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}

`twitter.write.dms` | Dangerous | Private messaging |\n| `twitter.webhooks.manage` | Dangerous | Inbound vector config |\n\n---\n\n## Agent Capabilities (Concrete Use Cases)\n\n### Social Listening \u0026 Research\n- Monitor brand mentions and sentiment in real-time\n- Track breaking news and trending topics\n- Research influencers and account histories\n- Analyze competitor social strategies\n- Detect emerging conversations about products/topics\n\n### Content \u0026 Engagement\n- Automated posting and thread creation\n- Schedule and manage content calendars\n- Cross-post from other content sources (blogs, YouTube, etc.)\n- Community engagement automation (likes, retweets, replies)\n- DM conversations for support, sales, or community\n\n### Examples of Agent Workflows\n```\n\"What are people saying about {product} on Twitter?\"\n\"Create a thread summarizing {topic} from these sources\"\n\"Monitor @competitor and alert me to significant announcements\"\n\"Post this content with optimal hashtags\"\n\"Research {person} and summarize their Twitter presence\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flywheel Ecosystem Synergies\n\n### Agent Mail Integration\n- Coordinate tweet storms across multiple agents\n- Route social mentions to appropriate agent handlers\n- Thread social interactions as mail messages for audit\n\n### CASS (Context-Aware Semantic Search)\n- Index social interactions for pattern learning\n- Semantic search over historical tweets/mentions\n- Learn optimal engagement timing and content styles\n\n### BV (Beads Viewer)\n- Track social engagement as task outcomes\n- Create beads from social monitoring alerts\n- Link social campaigns to project work\n\n### UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)\n- Lint tweets for policy compliance before posting\n- Check for sensitive content, banned words, legal issues\n- Validate thread formatting and length limits\n\n---\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### API Surface\n- **Implement both v1.1 and v2 APIs** for maximum coverage\n  - v1.1: DMs, some legacy endpoints\n  - v2: Tweets, users, lists, spaces (modern)\n- Handle rate limits gracefully with **token rotation**\n- Support **webhook subscriptions** for real-time events (Account Activity API)\n\n### Recommended Crates\n- `reqwest` — HTTP client with connection pooling\n- `tokio-tungstenite` — WebSocket for streaming\n- `oauth1-request` / `oauth2` — OAuth handling\n- `serde_json` — JSON parsing\n\n### Rate Limiting Strategy\n- Parse `x-rate-limit-*` headers on every response\n- Implement per-endpoint rate tracking\n- Never retry blindly; respect `Retry-After`\n- Support credential rotation for higher throughput\n\n---\n\n## Zone Architecture\n\n### Recommended Zones\n| Zone | Description | Capabilities |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `z:social:twitter:personal` | Full personal account access | All read/write/DM |\n| `z:social:twitter:brand` | Managed brand posting | Write tweets only |\n| `z:social:twitter:monitor` | Read-only monitoring | Search, read timelines |\n\n### Single-Zone Binding\n- One connector instance binds to exactly one `ZoneId`\n- Cannot cross-zone post from monitoring instance\n- Separate instances for separate accounts/zones\n\n---\n\n## Manifest Archetypes (Closed Set)\n- `operational` — REST actions (search, post, etc.)\n- `streaming` — Filtered stream ingestion\n- `bidirectional` — Read + publish workflows\n\n---\n\n## Threat Model\n\n**Twitter content is an adversarial prompt surface.**\n\n### Hard Requirements\n- Inbound content is tainted as external input by default\n- Strong

Observability and metrics\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Search Response Handling\n\nAlgolia returns rich search responses with:\n- Hits (matching records)\n- Facet counts\n- Query processing time\n- Number of hits\n- Pagination info\n\n```rust\npub struct SearchResponse\u003cT\u003e {\n    pub hits: Vec\u003cHit\u003cT\u003e\u003e,\n    pub nb_hits: u64,\n    pub page: u32,\n    pub nb_pages: u32,\n    pub hits_per_page: u32,\n    pub processing_time_ms: u32,\n    pub facets: Option\u003cHashMap\u003cString, HashMap\u003cString, u64\u003e\u003e\u003e,\n    pub query: String,\n}\n\npub struct Hit\u003cT\u003e {\n    pub object_id: String,\n    pub data: T,\n    pub highlight_result: Option\u003cHighlightResult\u003e,\n    pub snippet_result: Option\u003cSnippetResult\u003e,\n    pub ranking_info: Option\u003cRankingInfo\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n### Batch Operations\n\nAlgolia supports efficient batch operations:\n```rust\npub enum BatchAction {\n    AddObject { body: Value },\n    UpdateObject { object_id: String, body: Value },\n    PartialUpdateObject { object_id: String, body: Value },\n    DeleteObject { object_id: String },\n}\n\npub async fn batch(\u0026self, index: \u0026str, actions: Vec\u003cBatchAction\u003e) -\u003e Result\u003cBatchResponse\u003e;\n```\n\n### Wait for Task\n\nAlgolia operations are asynchronous. The connector should support waiting for task completion:\n```rust\npub async fn wait_for_task(\u0026self, index: \u0026str, task_id: u64) -\u003e Result\u003cTaskStatus\u003e;\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\ncrates/fcp-algolia/\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── src/\n│   ├── lib.rs           # Public API exports\n│   ├── client.rs        # Algolia client implementation\n│   ├── auth.rs          # Authentication handling\n│   ├── search.rs        # Search operations\n│   ├── records.rs       # Record CRUD operations\n│   ├── indices.rs       # Index management\n│   ├── synonyms.rs      # Synonym operations\n│   ├── rules.rs         # Query rules\n│   ├── analytics.rs     # Analytics operations\n│   ├── ab_testing.rs    # A/B testing\n│   ├── batch.rs         # Batch operations\n│   ├── types.rs         # Type definitions\n│   └── error.rs         # Error handling\n└── tests/\n    ├── integration/\n    │   ├── search_test.rs\n    │   ├── records_test.rs\n    │   └── indices_test.rs\n    └── unit/\n        └── types_test.rs\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Algolia REST API: https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/\n- Algolia API Clients: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/what-is-the-api-client/\n- Rate Limits: https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/#rate-limits\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Implement core search operations (search, multi-search, browse)\n- [ ] Implement record CRUD with batch support\n- [ ] Implement index management operations\n- [ ] Implement synonym and query rule management\n- [ ] Implement analytics read operations\n- [ ] Implement A/B testing operations\n- [ ] API key authentication with key type support\n- [ ] Zone-based rate limiting\n- [ ] Wait-for-task support for async operations\n- [ ] Proper error mapping to FCP error types\n- [ ] Unit tests for type serialization\n- [ ] Integration tests with Algolia sandbox\n","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:05:40.438660198-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-15T09:25:28.189818709-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-krt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:22.369804137-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-zx0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T22:08:22.39460678-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.20","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T03:37:25.745254534-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-lszk","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:07:26.48594774-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:07.280402867-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.19","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:07.695824472-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:08.107352536-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.26","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:08.535142046-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.31","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:08.940711177-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_connectors-zzpa","depends_on_id":"flywheel_connectors-1n78.35","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T07:09:09.36803059-05:00","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone"}]}
