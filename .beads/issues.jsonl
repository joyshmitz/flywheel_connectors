{"id":"flywheel_connectors-5vy","title":"fcp.webhook-receiver: Inbound Event Gateway","description":"# Inbound Event Gateway Meta-Connector\n\n**Force Multiplier:** Universal webhook receiver for external service integrations.\n\n## Overview\n\nMany services push events via webhooks (GitHub, Stripe, Discord, Slack, etc.). Instead of building separate webhook handlers for each service, this meta-connector provides a unified HTTP endpoint infrastructure with per-service configuration.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. HTTP Endpoint Management\n- Dynamic endpoint creation/deletion\n- Unique URL per webhook source\n- Support for path-based routing (`/webhooks/{service}/{id}`)\n- Health check endpoints\n- CORS and preflight handling\n- Rate limiting per endpoint\n\n### 2. Signature Verification (Per-Service)\n- Pluggable verification strategies:\n  - HMAC-SHA256 (GitHub, Stripe)\n  - HMAC-SHA1 (legacy services)\n  - Ed25519 (Discord)\n  - API key header\n  - Basic auth\n  - Custom verification functions\n- Timing-safe comparison\n- Signature caching for replay prevention\n- Failed verification alerting\n\n### 3. Payload Transformation\n- JSON schema validation\n- Payload normalization to common event format\n- Field mapping/extraction\n- Nested payload unwrapping\n- Binary payload handling (multipart)\n- Compression support (gzip, deflate)\n\n### 4. Event Routing to Zones\n- Route events to appropriate FCP zones\n- Support multiple destinations per event type\n- Filter events based on payload content\n- Priority-based routing\n- Fan-out to multiple handlers\n\n### 5. Retry/Dead-Letter Handling\n- Configurable retry strategies:\n  - Exponential backoff\n  - Fixed interval\n  - Fibonacci backoff\n- Dead letter queue for failed events\n- Manual retry interface\n- Event replay capability\n- TTL-based expiration\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"github-repo-events\"\npath = \"/webhooks/github/main-repo\"\nsignature_type = \"hmac-sha256\"\nsignature_header = \"X-Hub-Signature-256\"\nsecret = \"${GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.github-automation\"\nevent_type_header = \"X-GitHub-Event\"\n\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"stripe-payments\"\npath = \"/webhooks/stripe/payments\"\nsignature_type = \"stripe\"\nsecret = \"${STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.billing\"\nretry_max = 5\nretry_backoff = \"exponential\"\n\n[[webhooks]]\nname = \"discord-interactions\"\npath = \"/webhooks/discord/bot\"\nsignature_type = \"ed25519\"\npublic_key = \"${DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY}\"\nroute_to = \"zone.discord-bot\"\n```\n\n## Event Format (Normalized)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"evt_abc123\",\n  \"source\": \"github\",\n  \"type\": \"push\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"webhook_id\": \"github-repo-events\",\n  \"payload\": { ... },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"delivery_id\": \"xyz789\",\n    \"signature_valid\": true,\n    \"received_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Support 10+ common webhook signature types\n- [ ] Sub-50ms processing latency\n- [ ] 99.9% uptime for webhook endpoints\n- [ ] Complete audit trail for all received webhooks\n- [ ] Zero data loss with dead-letter queue\n- [ ] Hot-reload of webhook configurations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- HTTP server framework (axum/actix-web)\n- Persistent queue for dead-letter handling\n- Zone routing system\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- All secrets stored encrypted\n- IP allowlisting per webhook (optional)\n- Request size limits\n- Timeout handling\n- DDoS protection integration","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:06.647234418-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:06.647234418-05:00"}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-7ju","title":"fcp.mcp-bridge: MCP Gateway Meta-Connector","description":"# MCP Gateway Meta-Connector\n\n**Force Multiplier:** Connect to ANY MCP server and expose its tools via FCP.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis meta-connector acts as a universal bridge between the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem and FCP. Instead of building individual connectors for each service, we can leverage the growing MCP ecosystem by connecting to existing MCP servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. MCP Client in Rust\n- Implement full MCP client protocol in Rust\n- Support stdio, HTTP, and SSE transports\n- Handle MCP handshake and capability negotiation\n- Manage connection lifecycle (connect, reconnect, disconnect)\n- Support multiple concurrent MCP server connections\n\n### 2. Dynamic Tool Discovery\n- Query MCP server for available tools on connection\n- Subscribe to tool availability changes\n- Cache tool definitions with TTL\n- Handle tool versioning and deprecation\n- Support lazy loading of tool schemas\n\n### 3. Schema Translation (MCP → FCP)\n- Map MCP tool schemas to FCP action definitions\n- Convert MCP parameter types to FCP types\n- Handle required vs optional parameters\n- Translate MCP error codes to FCP error responses\n- Preserve metadata and documentation\n\n### 4. Capability Mapping\n- Map MCP capabilities to FCP permissions\n- Handle capability negotiation\n- Support capability-based access control\n- Document capability requirements per tool\n\n### 5. Zone Isolation\n- Each MCP server = separate FCP zone\n- Namespace tools by server (e.g., `mcp.github.create_issue`)\n- Isolate credentials per zone\n- Independent rate limiting per zone\n- Zone-level health monitoring\n\n### 6. Audit Trail\n- Log all MCP tool invocations\n- Capture request/response pairs\n- Track latency and error rates\n- Support structured logging (JSON)\n- Integrate with FCP audit system\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[mcp_servers]]\nname = \"github\"\ntransport = \"stdio\"\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"]\nenv = { GITHUB_TOKEN = \"${GITHUB_TOKEN}\" }\nzone = \"mcp.github\"\n\n[[mcp_servers]]\nname = \"filesystem\"\ntransport = \"stdio\"\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/allowed/path\"]\nzone = \"mcp.filesystem\"\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Connect to any compliant MCP server\n- [ ] Expose MCP tools as FCP actions\n- [ ] Zero manual configuration per MCP tool\n- [ ] Sub-100ms overhead for tool invocation\n- [ ] Graceful handling of MCP server failures\n- [ ] Complete audit trail for compliance\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- MCP specification documentation\n- FCP action definition format\n- Zone management system\n\n## References\n\n- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- [MCP Server Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:22:53.515206173-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:22:53.515206173-05:00"}

{"id":"flywheel_connectors-hc2","title":"fcp.cron: Scheduled Task Runner","description":"# Scheduled Task Runner Meta-Connector\n\n**Force Multiplier:** Time-based automation for FCP zones.\n\n## Overview\n\nMany automation workflows require scheduled execution: daily reports, periodic syncs, cleanup jobs, reminder systems. This meta-connector provides a robust scheduling infrastructure that triggers FCP actions on time-based schedules.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. Cron Expression Scheduling\n- Standard cron syntax (5-field and 6-field)\n- Extended syntax with seconds precision\n- Timezone-aware scheduling\n- Named schedules for common patterns\n- Cron expression validation and preview\n\n```\n# Standard patterns\n@hourly    = 0 * * * *\n@daily     = 0 0 * * *\n@weekly    = 0 0 * * 0\n@monthly   = 0 0 1 * *\n\n# Custom patterns\n*/15 * * * *     = Every 15 minutes\n0 9 * * 1-5      = 9 AM on weekdays\n0 0 1,15 * *     = 1st and 15th of month\n```\n\n### 2. One-Time Scheduled Tasks\n- Schedule task for specific datetime\n- Support for relative scheduling (\"in 30 minutes\")\n- Cancellation before execution\n- Rescheduling capability\n- Batch scheduling (multiple one-time tasks)\n\n### 3. Interval-Based Triggers\n- Fixed interval execution (every N minutes/hours/days)\n- Sliding window intervals\n- Jitter support for load distribution\n- Minimum interval enforcement\n- Pause/resume capability\n\n### 4. Task History and Logs\n- Complete execution history\n- Stdout/stderr capture\n- Execution duration tracking\n- Success/failure status\n- Searchable log storage\n- Log retention policies\n\n### 5. Failure Alerting\n- Configurable alert channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)\n- Alert on:\n  - Task failure\n  - Task timeout\n  - Consecutive failures\n  - Missed schedules\n- Alert suppression/snooze\n- Escalation policies\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```toml\n[[schedules]]\nname = \"daily-backup\"\ncron = \"0 2 * * *\"\ntimezone = \"America/New_York\"\naction = \"zone.backup.run_backup\"\nparams = { full = true }\ntimeout = \"1h\"\nalert_on_failure = true\n\n[[schedules]]\nname = \"hourly-sync\"\ninterval = \"1h\"\njitter = \"5m\"\naction = \"zone.sync.pull_updates\"\nretry_on_failure = 3\n\n[[one_time]]\nname = \"migration-task\"\nrun_at = \"2024-02-01T03:00:00Z\"\naction = \"zone.db.run_migration\"\nparams = { version = \"v2.0\" }\n```\n\n## Task State Machine\n\n```\nPENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED\n              ↓\n           FAILED → RETRYING → COMPLETED/FAILED\n              ↓\n         DEAD (max retries exceeded)\n```\n\n## Dashboard Features\n\n- Calendar view of scheduled tasks\n- Next N upcoming executions\n- Recent execution history\n- Live execution monitoring\n- Manual trigger capability\n- Bulk operations (pause all, resume all)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Sub-second scheduling precision\n- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent schedules\n- [ ] Missed task detection and alerting\n- [ ] Distributed execution (no single point of failure)\n- [ ] Complete audit trail\n- [ ] Hot-reload of schedule configurations\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Persistent storage for schedules and history\n- Time synchronization (NTP)\n- Alert channel integrations\n- Zone action invocation system\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Handle daylight saving time transitions\n- Cluster-safe (only one instance executes)\n- Graceful shutdown (complete running tasks)\n- Clock skew tolerance\n- Long-running task support","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:20.104073834-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T10:23:20.104073834-05:00"}
