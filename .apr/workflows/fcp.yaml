  NOW: Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc. For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along with the git-diff style change versus the original plan shown below:

  ```
  {{SPEC}}

  And here is a document detailing Rust implementations for the canonical connector types that follow the specification document given below; you should also keep the implementation in mind as you think about the specification, since ultimately the specification needs to be translated into the Rust code eventually!
