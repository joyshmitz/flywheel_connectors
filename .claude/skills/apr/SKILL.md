# APR - Automated Plan Reviser for FCP

This skill automates iterative specification refinement using GPT Pro 5.2 Extended Reasoning via Oracle.

## Quick Start

**Run next round (fully automated):**
```
run apr round <N>
```

This will:
1. Run `apr run <N> --wait` to get GPT Pro feedback
2. Read and analyze all revisions
3. Integrate each revision into FCP_Specification_V2.md
4. Harmonize README.md with changes
5. Harmonize docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md
6. Commit changes in logical groups with detailed messages
7. Push to remote

**Run continuous rounds:**
```
keep running apr rounds starting from <N>
```

## Overview

The Flywheel Connector Protocol (FCP) specification is refined through multiple rounds of GPT Pro review. Each round:
1. Sends README + spec (optionally + implementation) to GPT Pro 5.2
2. Receives detailed revision suggestions with rationale
3. Integrates feedback into the spec via Claude Code
4. Harmonizes README and implementation docs
5. Commits with detailed messages

## Oracle Remote Setup (One-Time)

For headless/SSH environments, Oracle can delegate browser automation to a local machine.

### On the LOCAL machine (with browser/GUI):
```bash
# Install Oracle if needed
npm install -g @steipete/oracle

# Start server (keep this terminal open)
# IMPORTANT: Use port 9333 (not 9222) to avoid conflict with Chrome DevTools
oracle serve --port 9333 --token "flywheel-apr-2026"
```

### On the REMOTE machine (this server):
```bash
# Add to shell config for persistence
echo 'export ORACLE_REMOTE_HOST="100.114.183.31:9333"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export ORACLE_REMOTE_TOKEN="flywheel-apr-2026"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Test connection
oracle -p "test connection" -e browser -m "5.2 Pro"
```

**Why port 9333?** Oracle serve listens on this port for incoming requests. When it
receives a request, it launches Chrome which uses port 9222 for DevTools Protocol.
Using 9333 for the server avoids the port conflict.

**Tailscale IPs for this setup:**
- Mac Mini: `100.114.183.31`
- iMac: `100.81.209.68`
- This server (threadripperje): `100.91.120.17`

## Commands

**Important: Always run APR from the project directory:**
```bash
cd /data/projects/flywheel_connectors
```

### Check Status
```bash
apr status          # Check Oracle sessions
apr list            # List workflows
apr history         # Show revision history
apr dashboard       # Interactive analytics
```

### Run a Revision Round
```bash
# Standard round (README + spec only)
apr run <N> --wait

# Include implementation doc (manual override)
apr run <N> --include-impl --wait

# With impl_every_n: 4 in workflow config, impl is auto-included on rounds 4, 8, 12...

# Preview without sending
apr run <N> --dry-run

# Render prompt for manual paste
apr run <N> --render --output /tmp/prompt.md
```

### How Documents Are Sent

APR pastes document contents **inline** (not as file attachments). This is more reliable:
- No "duplicate file" errors from ChatGPT
- No silent upload failures
- Works consistently for documents up to ~200KB

### View and Compare Rounds
```bash
apr show <N>        # View round output
apr diff <N> <M>    # Compare two rounds
apr diff <N>        # Compare round N vs N-1
```

## Automated Integration Workflow

When user requests a round, Claude Code performs these steps automatically:

### Step 1: Run APR and Get Feedback
```bash
apr run <N> --wait
```

### Step 2: Read and Analyze Revisions
- Read `.apr/rounds/fcp/round_<N>.md`
- Parse all revision suggestions
- Create todo list for each revision

### Step 3: Integrate Each Revision
For each revision in the GPT Pro output:
- Locate relevant sections in FCP_Specification_V2.md
- Apply changes (add structs, modify enums, update comments)
- Ensure NORMATIVE sections are properly marked

### Step 4: Harmonize README.md
- Update terminology table if new concepts added
- Update architecture sections for protocol changes
- Update security sections for new safety features
- Keep descriptions concise and user-focused

### Step 5: Harmonize Implementation Doc
- Update docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md
- Sync all struct definitions with spec
- Update code examples to match new signatures
- Ensure NORMATIVE annotations match spec

### Step 6: Commit and Push
Create logical commits:
1. Main spec changes (docs(fcp): ...)
2. README harmonization (docs(readme): ...)
3. Implementation doc (docs(connectors): ...)
4. APR round output (chore(apr): ...)

Then push to remote.

## After Compaction Recovery

If context compaction occurs, re-prime before continuing:
```
Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind. Also reread the entire
V2 spec so it's fresh before you read docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md.
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `FCP_Specification_V2.md` | Main protocol specification (~145 KB) |
| `README.md` | Project overview and quick start (~44 KB) |
| `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md` | Rust implementation guide (~70 KB) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Development rules and guidelines (~25 KB) |
| `.apr/rounds/fcp/round_N.md` | GPT Pro outputs for each round |

## Workflow Configuration

The APR workflow is configured in `.apr/workflows/fcp.yaml`:
- **Documents**: README.md, FCP_Specification_V2.md, docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md
- **Model**: GPT Pro 5.2 with Extended Thinking
- **Output**: `.apr/rounds/fcp/`
- **impl_every_n**: 4 (auto-include implementation every 4th round)

## Tips

1. **impl_every_n handles periodic inclusion** - With `impl_every_n: 4`, rounds 4, 8, 12... auto-include implementation
2. **Don't skip harmonization** - Changes should flow through all docs
3. **Watch for convergence** - Use `apr stats` to see if changes are dampening
4. **Target 15-20 rounds** - For complex protocols, more iterations = better spec
5. **New session per round** - Start fresh GPT Pro conversations to avoid context pollution

## Troubleshooting

### Oracle Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if Oracle server is running on local machine
# On local: oracle serve --port 9333 --token "..."

# Verify Tailscale connectivity
tailscale ping 100.114.183.31

# Test Oracle directly
oracle -p "test" -e browser -m "5.2 Pro" -v
```

### APR Issues
```bash
# Verbose mode for debugging
apr run <N> -v

# Check workflow config
cat .apr/workflows/fcp.yaml

# Verify files exist
ls -la README.md FCP_Specification_V2.md docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md

# Clear stale lock
rm -f .apr/.locks/fcp_round_<N>.lock
```

## Round History

| Round | Status | Key Changes |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Complete | Initial refinements |
| 2 | Complete | sender_instance_id, ZoneRekeyPolicy, ApprovalToken, session nonces, GC mirroring, simulate, RoleObject, NetworkConstraints, WASI |
| 3 | Pending | - |
