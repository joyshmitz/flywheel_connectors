# FCP2 Requirements Index: Spec-to-Implementation Matrix (V2-only)

> **Status**: NORMATIVE
> **Version**: 1.0.0
> **Last Updated**: January 2026
> **Bead Reference**: `flywheel_connectors-1n78.1`

---

## Purpose

This document is the **single source of truth** mapping from:
- `FCP_Specification_V2.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/fcp_model_connectors_rust.md`

...to the **owning Beads** (implementation + tests).

**Goal**: Engineers should be able to implement FCP2 by following the Beads graph **without rereading the spec/docs**.

---

## How to Use This Document

- Treat each entry as a **mechanical checklist** item.
- When you discover a missing requirement, update this matrix first, then:
  - Create the missing owning bead(s), OR
  - Expand the owning bead's scope/acceptance criteria/tests.

---

## Conformance Profiles (Spec §25)

| Profile | Description | Target |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **MVP** | Must ship first | Reference implementation default |
| **Full** | Post-MVP hardening | Enabled by explicit configuration/policy |

This matrix labels items as **MVP** or **Full**. Many are shared.

---

## V2-Only Clarifications (Spec §26)

- FCP2 makes **no backwards-compat guarantees** with FCP1.
- No hybrid translator layer.
- Clean cutover only.

---

## Pricing / Cost Tracking Clarification

- Connectors MUST emit **usage metrics**.
- We do **not** embed hard-coded pricing tables in connectors (pricing changes frequently).
- If cost estimates are supported, they are explicit and policy/ops-owned (e.g., `CostEstimate`).

# A) Spec Coverage Matrix — `FCP_Specification_V2.md`

Below, each chapter lists:
- **Owners**: Implementation beads responsible for building it.
- **Primary Tests/Conformance**: Golden vectors, fuzz, interop, E2E, compliance runner.
- **Notes / Key Requirements**: The "sharp edges" we must not forget.

| **Notes** | Canonical identifier formats; reject non-canonical forms (no silent normalization). ObjectHeader rules + retention semantics and root pointers. HPKE sealed box shape requirements (used by zone crypto). ZoneCheckpoint is the "root pointer" (GC/security). |

---

## §4: Symbol Layer

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.12` (FCPS framing + SymbolEnvelope AEAD), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.24` (session auth, key schedule, anti-replay), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.14` (RaptorQ + chunking), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.17.2` (multipath + transport priority) |

---

## §5: Zone Architecture

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.26` (ZoneDefinition/ZonePolicy/roles/resource objects/reason codes), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.16` (Zone ↔ Tailscale tag mapping, port gating), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.6` (zone crypto key distribution), `flywheel_connectors-6o25.5` (optional MLS/TreeKEM PCS zones) |
| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.26.1` (policy decision vectors) |

|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.8` (provenance model, taint propagation, elevation protocol), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.11` (DecisionReceipt evidence + explainability) |
| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.36.4` (E2E taint/approval flow) |
| **Notes** | Taint propagation is mechanical. Elevation/declassification requires ApprovalTokens and receipts. |

---

## §7: Capability System

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.7` (CapabilityObject + COSE_Sign1 tokens), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.18` (egress proxy + NetworkConstraints enforcement), `flywheel_connectors-kt9r` (credential injection model + zeroize discipline), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.26` (roles/bundles, placement policy) |
| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.5` (mechanical compliance runner), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.3` (interop tokens/handshake) |
| **Notes** | Capability IDs MUST NOT encode hostnames/ports; use `network_constraints`. Risky/Dangerous requires holder binding proof where applicable. Egress proxy credential injection is normative for strict/moderate. |

---

| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.21.4` (system E2E harness) |
| **Notes** | Admission control is mandatory; symbol request bounding is the big DoS surface. Distributed state must be convergent; quarantine prevents storage poisoning. |

---

## §9: Wire Protocol

| **Notes** | Epoch finalization must be deterministic and bounded. Binary bytes are untrusted until verified; quarantine-by-default. |

---

## §21: Offline Access

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-31c7` (offline capability + predictive pre-staging), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.15` (background repair + coverage evaluation) |
| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-f3xi` (offline capability unit tests), `flywheel_connectors-1n78.36.5` (E2E offline/repair) |

| **Tests** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.36.*` (E2E requires structured logs) |
| **Notes** | Structured logs MUST include trace/correlation. Audit chain advancement requires quorum unless degraded. |

---

## §24: Error Taxonomy

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | `flywheel_connectors-1n78.29` (FCP-XXXX ranges, retry semantics, AI recovery hints) |
